American&#39;s have retained much of their puritan heritage (AKA baggage) and their cultural views on sex. \nThere is an strong undertone of protecting the fairer sex (there would be no outrage if jailbait was just full of recent sexually-developed young men). This argument that the girls are being &quot;exploited&quot; by being looked at on a monitor by perverted men is an extension of puritanical beliefs on the &quot;temple of our bodies&quot;. That is, god granted us an innocent and pure body and it must not be sullied by sex, or even the act of being looked at by others with thoughts of sex. Much of &quot;PROTECT THE CHILDREN&quot; paranoia sweeping through the US is a result of this. \nEven if you are non-religious, any intelligent American has to admit that they too are influenced by these (I believe backward) undertows of American culture, which to this day remain firmly integrated. But to be aware of such influence, especially in such relevant arguments around the banning of <a href=\"/r/jailbait\">r/jailbait<\/a>, is critical in coming to terms and understanding why the community supports the move (and blind to what you say Frumpy_stumpster).

I suppose it has to do with the nature of changing societal and cultural morality.\nJust because something was acceptable in the past does not give it any validity in modern times. Take any other subject: religion, race, women&#39;s rights and go back 200 hundred years, and you&#39;ll (hopefully) find the attitudes then to such matters as unacceptable by today&#39;s standards. \nI&#39;m not saying it invalidates your point necessarily, but personally I find history to be a dry well when looking for moral direction.\nI was sexually active at 14, with other similar aged partners. I&#39;m sure I would have, as I&#39;m sure I had fantasized often about, had sex with older women, particularly some of my teachers. I think this is pretty normal. I honestly don&#39;t know if similar aged girls did the same about men. I&#39;m not sure what affect it would have had on me had I been able to carry out such a fantasy.

Teenagers by and large don&#39;t know shit, and that&#39;s because they&#39;re going through all that growing up bullshit part of their life, often the most difficult part. Its also a period when they&#39;re vulnerable. Hormones conflict with reason and naivety can be manipulated.

It&#39;s the power dynamic. You know this. Just because a girl&#39;s body is developed doesn&#39;t mean she is mature mentally. I grew tits at 12 - do you really think I could handle a 22 year old coming on to me? That I knew what to do about that? Or how to say no? The first guy I slept with was 24. I was 14. He manipulated me, played on my insecurities, convinced me that he loved me and that sex is what you do with people who love you. Really, I just wanted to watch cartoons and read Anne McCaffrey novels. I wanted someone to love me and I wanted to please him. I was curious about sex, but in no way was I ready for it. I was terrified, it hurt, I cried for hours and felt dirty for days afterwards. It was the beginning of a long Downward spiral where I thought no guy would ever like me if I didn&#39;t put out. And I thought it was my fault for a long long time. Now, in my 30s, I know that there was something deeply fucking wrong with that guy. He was a predator and I was prey. And while he didn&#39;t rape me, he did destroy my innocence and fuck up my views of sex for a long time. \nI have never told this story to anyone before.\nAnd that&#39;s why, boys and girls, it&#39;s not ok to fuck someone who is a child when you are an adult.

On the most basic level, our minds see a fertile potential mate, and we desire them. We don&#39;t differentiate, on this primal level, between 15 years old and 18 years old. We see the potential for childbearing, or lack thereof. \nI, as a 17 year old male, visited <a href=\"/r/jailbait\">r/jailbait<\/a> from time to time. I happen to find sexually mature girls in my own age range to be attractive. That doesn&#39;t make me a pedophile. That said, there was definitely a &quot;too young&quot; line that always made me really uncomfortable when crossed. It was never attached to a number, though, but rather sexual maturity. Of course, this is much too fuzzy a line to make laws on, we have to have an objective standard to draw the line by, and the best way to do that is age in years. Laws must be cut and dry. Morality rarely, if ever, is.The other issue is the candid pictures that are so frequently posted to <a href=\"/r/jailbait\">r/jailbait<\/a>. I find that taking sexually suggestive pictures, and proceeding to distribute them to a massive audience, is entirely morally reprehensible, regardless of the subject&#39;s age.\nFor me, when you come down to it, it&#39;s a censorship issue. I&#39;ll go ahead and be the 99th person to express the fact that I understand that reddit is privately owned, and not subject to the ideals laid out in the constitution. But they still have a set of ideals of their own, that are defined by their actions. Banning of <a href=\"/r/jailbait\">r/jailbait<\/a> sets a precedent for future censorship. Next, as many others could be <a href=\"/r/trees\">r/trees<\/a>. Then perhaps things like hate speech, et cetera. Basically, you are faced with the question of where to draw the line. As another redditor put it, once you decide to eliminate or ban some content, you are responsible for literally everything that you didn&#39;t. I&#39;d rather deal with creeps and racists and even the Phelps-Roepers of the world, because the alternative is someone else dictating what I can and can&#39;t say./manifesto\nDamn, that turned out longer than I thought.
