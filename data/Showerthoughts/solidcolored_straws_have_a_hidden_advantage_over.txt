How long are your sips?

Depends on the beverage. If it’s a tea or soda, the caffeine causes it to be fairly quick, maybe 6 minutes. If it’s a non-caffeinated drink, one sip takes around an hour.

That&#39;s some intense sippage.

I like how you’ve thought this through

You aren’t obligated to speak, pretty much ever &gt;.&gt;

Even colored straws get darker when liquid is I them so you can see when someone is drinking

I’m gonna risk getting the darn it bot to emphasize my darn, so darn it! Well, it’s not as obvious as the clear straw. Honestly it probably depends on the lighting in the room.

Only if you also have an opaque glass

It&#39;s pretty obvious whether or not someone is actually sucking on the straw.
