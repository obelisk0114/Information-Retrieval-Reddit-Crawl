Do I still have to tip my Robo-waiter?

touch screens and made to order as seen in sandwich shops and gas stations for years now

Yes but soon the people serving your food to you will be machines/robots. They already exist in someplaces, so once it spreads it will make human servers a novelty

Food companies will probably try to keep tipping &quot;in style&quot; to squeeze in a couple more bucks even though the money isn&#39;t going towards the machines.

Thank god, I&#39;m so tired of tipping to compensate for someone&#39;s shitty restaurant and life choices.
