As a parent it is when your kids are no longer on your mobile plan.

LPT: Never put parents as mom and dad in your phone. In case it&#39;s stolen, they will know exactly who to call.

Who to call for what?


Uke_Shorty     Sun Feb 4 21:12:37 2018 UTC

They&#39;ll know to call your parents for threatening them and maybe taking money from them, telling they have you. I don&#39;t live in a very peaceful country.

Exactly. I do this for the exact same reason. I lol’d when he asked “for what”. On the other hand, must be nice to feel so safe.

I thought of answering sarcastically.... But then I thought, some places at this planet are safe...

My home will always be where my parents are. And where my family is. You can have different kinds of home

Mom hasn&#39;t had a land line in years!

I moved out 14 years ago and it’s still Home.

And you&#39;ve gotten old when you change &quot;Mom and Dad&#39;s&quot; to &quot;Mom&quot;


redfricker     Sun Feb 4 21:52:13 2018 UTC

Who the fuck still has a home phone...


LordNelson27     Sun Feb 4 22:07:26 2018 UTC

My parents got rid of their landlines

That&#39;s how I know they&#39;ve grown up.
