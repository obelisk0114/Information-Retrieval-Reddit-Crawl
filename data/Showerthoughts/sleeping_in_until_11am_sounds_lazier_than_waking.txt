Still better than waking up at 9am and staying in bed til 2 or 3pm not sleeping, not doing anything but browsing reddit on my phone because I have lost the will to motivate myself so now the only way I motivate myself is through guilt.


Arrivaderchie     Sun Feb 4 23:27:07 2018 UTC

And then that foggy-headed, hopeless feeling of drained depression when you finally drag yourself outside at 4pm to go get food and realize you&#39;ve pretty much wasted the day


Alecazzzam     Sun Feb 4 23:34:34 2018 UTC

Oh god man this hits home so hard. For over a year now every day I wake up I force myself to eat something at least something light but it‚Äôs like I have no desire or appetite anymore it‚Äôs just withered away.


ToddlerCain     Mon Feb 5 00:20:41 2018 UTC

I was in the same situation as you for a year and a half. Seriously the last half year of that was me playing video games for like three hours every day and sleeping the rest of the time. But now I&#39;ve been really active for like 4 months. Dropping 5 kg of weight, being up and about at nine in the morning, running. I&#39;ll promise you will get through it as well. Lots of love to you ‚ù§Ô∏è I know first hand how hopeless it all seems. 


-Beth-     Mon Feb 5 00:36:49 2018 UTC

How did you get out of it? I&#39;m in a similar situation that you used to be in.


ToddlerCain     Mon Feb 5 01:00:33 2018 UTC

Honestly it was the smallest steps. Like taking a shower as soon as I wake up I  the morning and not in the evening right before I had to run to the store to buy food. That took me weeks, maybe months to go through. Then I started to try to get up earlier. Like putting my alarm clock at 12 and try to not fall asleep again. Then I tried to take a walk maybe once a week. It seems small, but those things really helped me. I think most people agree that a good sleep cycle, good food and exercise are important to feel better. But it&#39;s really, really, really hard to do. So I had to start small. But then when I was up at 10, went for a walk and then showered things really started to progress. I realized that I took a step back every time I went out drinking, so now I drink two or three beers and then stop. I used to drink a litre or more coca cola everyday and as I stopped doing that I felt better as well.
I&#39;m sorry, this became a rambling mess. But if I where to give you one tip I would say that the most important thing for me was to put up a really small goal (such as showering when I wake up) and completing it. I think we still have a lot of fighting spirit in us. But we can&#39;t begin by trying to lift a mountain. Just lifting one pebble is enough in the beginning. I don&#39;t know if I answered your question, but feel free to ask away if you&#39;re thinking of something else. I can only attest to what worked for me, but sometimes I think that it&#39;s enough that someone listens to you :) 


apartment13     Mon Feb 5 01:09:05 2018 UTC

I am not as bad as you used to be but am currently in a rut of waking up far too late and missing uni lectures, usually 11am-1pm, and often staying in bed later than that. I appreciate that advice about starting small: I will try to wake up for 10am tomorrow, rather than forcing myself to wake up at 8am which has just not worked at all for me.


quadnips     Mon Feb 5 01:10:11 2018 UTC

Happy that you have been getting better. Hope it stays that way for you my friend


ChrisHarperMercer     Mon Feb 5 01:02:35 2018 UTC

I personally stopped drinking and smoking pot and it completely changed my life. Right now I&#39;m sitting at home alone with my dog watching the game and it&#39;s better than going out and partying with anyone.


frex_mcgee     Mon Feb 5 01:06:45 2018 UTC

Hey, I was just trolling through and saw your comment and for some reason felt really drawn in all of a sudden. I‚Äôm someone who also struggles with this &amp; still does? every day, despite knowing better. What I can say that not everyone else here has is: I completely agree with it all! Because everyone is different and we all have different coping mechanisms, but what we do know is: exercise &amp; being active helps depression immensely; smoking marijuana helps with crippling anxieties and is a stress reliever when used appropriately and in the right manner for whomever is using it; setting a routine is extremely important because we are mammals and mammals crave routine. But I also wanted to just say that, like an addict, you should take it one day at a time. It‚Äôs okay to be in a funk, it‚Äôs okay to be sad, and it‚Äôs okay to have lazy days. But be honest with yourself about the effort you‚Äôre really making. That  ‚Äúlittle voice‚Äù has made all of the difference for me. 


Phazon2000     Mon Feb 5 00:53:23 2018 UTC

but it‚Äôs like I have no desire or appetite anymore it‚Äôs just withered away.
You have to go out and exercise or exert yourself through working all day. Then you will get hungry.
During the period when I was unemployed and not exercising I was never hungry. Ate two small meals a day and didn&#39;t care.
After work/exercise? I&#39;d roar in a fit of rage if I forgot my morning tea sausage roll at home because that&#39;s 1/5 meals I wouldn&#39;t get. Constantly hungry.

testertop     Mon Feb 5 01:20:40 2018 UTC

This happened to me. Spent a year unemployed after college living at home. Developed lots of things that I still can&#39;t break to this day but trying and slowly progressing. Just accepted an offer of $60/hour :) it will get better my friend. Keep on keeping on!


Capt_Palmer     Sun Feb 4 23:59:00 2018 UTC

&quot;my advice to you.... Is to start drinking heavily&quot; -John Belushi
But seriously don&#39;t, smoke pot, no liver failure.


makalasu     Mon Feb 5 00:42:50 2018 UTC

Pot is most definitely not the answer here. Trust me. Physical excercise and a proper routine are (IMO) the only things that can get you out of this viscious cycle. Pot only makes you lose even more motivation.


NotATrueRedHead     Mon Feb 5 01:07:06 2018 UTC

Maybe not for everyone but it certainly helps me get things done. Depends on strain, etc.


UltrafastFS_IR_Laser     Mon Feb 5 00:58:56 2018 UTC

Pot will never cure depression. Pot will make you care less about it, but it won&#39;t motivate you to take better care or go out and do something.

PM_ME_YOUR_TINY_JUGS     Sun Feb 4 23:28:32 2018 UTC

My problem is that, as well as being lazy, I also hate being late and get quite anxious about it. This problem has resulted in many rushed mornings.


Zopiti-Bopbop     Sun Feb 4 23:33:31 2018 UTC

That andrenalin rush when you look at the time and jump out of the bed


Soramke     Mon Feb 5 00:34:39 2018 UTC

I also get anxious about being late, which results in just skipping class a lot even though I want to go because I don&#39;t want to have to walk in to everybody staring at me 5 or 10 minutes after the class began for the third class in a row. Can&#39;t get out of bed &#39;cause depression, get distracted getting ready &#39;cause ADHD, can&#39;t stand being late &#39;cause anxiety, so I just stay home. Which isn&#39;t to say that it&#39;s not my fault, obviously it&#39;s my job to find the motivation to get to class. It&#39;s something I&#39;m working on.


PM_ME_YOUR_TINY_JUGS     Mon Feb 5 00:38:50 2018 UTC

Krymea     Mon Feb 5 01:01:06 2018 UTC

Reminds me of myself in first year of university. After a while I just skipped almost every class because I was being scared of &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you around till now&quot; or &quot;look who&#39;s here&quot; type of comments. Plus, I was soooo behind..After all it turned out well but it took a while.


GreatestOfAllTime96     Mon Feb 5 00:06:00 2018 UTC

Get a cat. It will abuse you into finding motivation to get up early.

Or it will crawl under the blanket when you&#39;re just about ready to get out of bed and you start all over again.


RafeHaab     Mon Feb 5 01:09:17 2018 UTC

Why would you remanin in bed after an animal just crawled under the blankets? That would be an insta-get up for me. And I would be <em>pissed off</em>


Nandeenah     Sun Feb 4 23:34:36 2018 UTC

yes but then I go back in bed to sleep/reddit


RafeHaab     Mon Feb 5 01:11:03 2018 UTC

That can be corrected. Push the cat off the bed before you go back to redditing. Do this a few times, and It will start becoming more annoting every time, until it ends up either scratching you or sitting in your face. That will convince you to get up.


JLPM     Mon Feb 5 00:02:16 2018 UTC

I get it man but it‚Äôs kinda makes it even shittier when you‚Äôre only living so other people won‚Äôt be sad 


Thunt_Cunder     Mon Feb 5 00:48:17 2018 UTC

It goes hand in hand, and at least you can take some measure of joy knowing that even your presence brings comfort to your loved ones. Life has it&#39;s ups and downs, and it&#39;s the downs that give the ups meaning. When you&#39;re finally free of your chemical handcuffs you&#39;ll look back on this as just another hurdle. 
Always keep in mind that your brain is invariably going to suffer a chemical imbalance, drugs can do crazy things to your biochemistry. You&#39;re not &quot;sad&quot; as much as your brain is learning how to tell you you&#39;re happy. You just have to give it some time to figure things out, and do your best to help it along by living healthy and throwing yourself into whatever you set your mind on. 
There&#39;s a reddit post that really helped me beat some demons. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> it is if you care to give it a read.

ProductofBoredom     Sun Feb 4 23:10:35 2018 UTC

Work your way through a Spanish textbook? Then you Alleviate boredom and learn something.
Oh, or podcasts! Lore is really cool, so are Pleasuretown and Critical Role.


McLovin804     Sun Feb 4 23:15:29 2018 UTC

I always end up tired or falling asleep trying to listen to podcasts.


freezingbyzantium     Sun Feb 4 23:35:56 2018 UTC

Yeah, I can&#39;t browse the net or anything because then I won&#39;t take in what they&#39;re saying, but if I focus entirely on the podcast I get sleepy ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


Pun-Master-General     Sun Feb 4 23:44:52 2018 UTC

I like listening to them while walking/driving around or doing chores.  I find that&#39;s just the right amount of focus to not get bored listening to it but also still follow what&#39;s going on.


notLOL     Sun Feb 4 23:55:27 2018 UTC

Hey brother, I&#39;m going through a rough spot right now too, woman wise. 
Just know that you gotta keep on trekking. You <em>need</em> to keep making progress. Don&#39;t let yourself get stuck in a rut. Just work on something everyday. Maybe hit the gym, work on a personal project, whatever. 
Just make sure you do <em>something</em> and don&#39;t let yourself fall into nothing. 


CuCl2     Sun Feb 4 23:54:24 2018 UTC

Remember, building discipline is more important than waiting for motivation. Motivation is fleeting. Motivation is bullshit.

It makes sense when you view it as the byproduct of our country&#39;s reverence of capitalism. If the wealthy can convince the working class that exhaustion is a badge of honor, then those people will feel better about working themselves to the bone.
It has been this way for a <em>long</em> time, too. I would argue that our standards for working are probably more lenient than they&#39;ve ever been, but we&#39;re still far too demanding compared to the rest of the world.

thishummuslife     Mon Feb 5 00:40:52 2018 UTC

I&#39;m not here to offer an opinion, but if you&#39;re intersted in learning a little about sleep there&#39;s an interesting podcast on NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/16/558058812/sleep-scientist-warns-against-walking-through-life-in-an-underslept-state" rel="nofollow">here</a>   
From the podcast:<blockquote>
Walker is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He points out that lack of sleep ‚Äî defined as six hours or fewer ‚Äî can have serious consequences. Sleep deficiency is associated with problems in concentration, memory and the immune system, and may even shorten life span.

NotJosephJoffre     Sun Feb 4 23:30:22 2018 UTC

I mean, there are some dealings with mental and physical health that are affected by sleep schedules, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s affected so much by time of sleep rather than how long you sleep. 


WreckitWranche     Sun Feb 4 23:43:57 2018 UTC

Yeah its strongly associated with the amount of natural daylight you get


TheMarlboroMang     Mon Feb 5 01:08:32 2018 UTC

Dat vitamin D tho


tiocfaidharlulz     Mon Feb 5 00:17:52 2018 UTC

It&#39;s also affected by when you sleep apparently? Some research has suggested that non-REM sleep is deeper and more restorative than REM sleep. This is important because you&#39;ll either get more non-REM or REM sleep, depending on what time you go to bed. Studies basically suggest that non-REM sleep tends to dominate people&#39;s sleep cycles in the early part of the night, but later on (3am or after) REM sleep reflexes kick in. 
So basically it might be that people need more non-REM sleep for their health, but late nights mean they get more REM sleep instead. 


IWugYouWugHeSheMeWug     Mon Feb 5 00:00:09 2018 UTC

I work from home, set my own hours, and I&#39;m not a morning person, so I <em>never</em> wake up before 9am. I usually don&#39;t sleep much past 10am and I never sleep past 11am. It works for me because, not being a morning person and working for a company based in California, I essentially operate as if I live on the west coast even though I live on the east coast.
Yet every time I go visit my parents for holidays or whatever, I get lectured about how I should have a better sleep schedule and not sleep in so late.
THERE&#39;S NO GODDAMN FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE between sleep 2am to 10am or 12am to 8am, especially when I have at least one or two meetings a week well after 5pm local time.


Chronoblivion     Mon Feb 5 00:38:53 2018 UTC

I work second shift and am rarely home before midnight. I stay up at least a few hours and sleep until at least noon most days, sometimes later. When I first started this schedule (over 7 years ago) my mother-in-law made a couple passive-aggressive comments about it, hinting that I&#39;m lazy for sleeping so late. A year or two later and my brother-in-law (who still lived at home) starts working a similar schedule, and suddenly my odd hours aren&#39;t an issue.


IWugYouWugHeSheMeWug     Mon Feb 5 00:51:33 2018 UTC

Heh, I seriously can never understand how some people can be so judgemental about other people&#39;s sleep schedules. I just get so annoyed with comments about mine because it&#39;s not even <em>that</em> unusual. Functioning as if I live a few timezones away still works out because if I have evening plans, they&#39;re <em>usually</em> not going to start before 7 or 8pm anyway, so instead of logging off for the day and then hanging around for three hours, I log off and then immediately go out. And anything I&#39;m doing that doesn&#39;t involve going out can be done at any point. But of course, because I&#39;m not waking up at 8am to go to a 9 to 5 job like you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to, it&#39;s an issue.

I hear that. I work 7pm to 7 am normally so my days off im up till the morning and sleeping till like 5 at night. It seems weird to other people that im up so late but its what my body is used to


rsqejfwflqkj     Mon Feb 5 00:03:17 2018 UTC

What do you do between 8pm and 4am? That&#39;s 8 hours and you clearly live close to work. Is another hour or two earlier really eating up &quot;all your free time&quot;?


AdeonWriter     Mon Feb 5 00:52:20 2018 UTC

I litterally cannot enjoy myself before work. I want to wake up, immedately go to work, and get it over with, so it&#39;s out of my head. Any time up before work is just stressing over the clock waiting to leave to go to work. I can&#39;t enjoy myself. Life starts when work ends.


thepoisonman     Mon Feb 5 00:06:39 2018 UTC

I had that schedule from college until 27. Then I got a morning job and I hate mornings. I use to work from 4pm-2am for 4 years and I miss it. 


TyMiles2012     Mon Feb 5 00:17:59 2018 UTC

Pretty close to mine.  Up until 4 to 5am, wake up at 9 or 10am (Alarm set to 9 and I snooze for an hour), attend class from 12:30 to 2:20pm, work from 3pm to 12am, repeat.
Here&#39;s the weird thing though.  Sometimes I work on Sundays from 8am until 5pm.  I usually stay up until the same amount of time and I always get out of bed at 6:30.  Even though that&#39;s around only 2 hours of sleep or less, I have way more energy at work and I can stay up without having to nap after work, and I can stay up until the same time and wake up during the week normally without issues or hindrances to my sleep schedule.  On normal work days, I&#39;m always nodding off between 5 and 8pm.  If I had to guess, it&#39;s probably the &quot;Oh shit I might miss my alarm&quot; on work Sundays so I have a hard time sleeping anyway because I try to sleep while anxious on missing my super early alarm.


spicy_af_69     Mon Feb 5 00:59:00 2018 UTC

Learn to go to bed early and wake up early so you can utilize your morning hours. Then you don&#39;t have to complain about everything being closed. 


AdeonWriter     Mon Feb 5 01:03:23 2018 UTC

It is virtually impossible for me to &quot;relax&quot; before work. I want to wake up, and immedately go to work and get it over with. I can&#39;t have free time &quot;before work&quot; I will not enjoy myself, I&#39;ll just constantly watch the clock waiting for work. That is no way to live. Life starts when work ends.


Tuckertcs     Sun Feb 4 20:48:11 2018 UTC

Also staying up late and is normal while sleeping early isn‚Äôt. Yet if you stay up and wake up late you could sleep the same time as going to bed early and waking up early.

This somehow doesn&#39;t get across people&#39;s minds sometimes. I simply work better late at night so I have my schedule where I can go to sleep around two and wake up at ten most days, but my roommate can&#39;t understand that him going to bed at ten and waking up at six is the exact same thing and I&#39;m not crazy for wanting his barking dogs t be kept inside in the morning because he&#39;d damn sure be unhappy if I had a barking dog that I left out till midnight to keep him up.


SomethingLessEdgy     Sun Feb 4 23:41:20 2018 UTC

Ok this whooooole thread could be fixed if you got yourself some cheap ass ear plugs. I copped some from my last job and god damn, they&#39;re just...god tier. I was able to get a 4 hour power nap at my gmas when the house was filled with 6 extremely loud women. Must have. If I loose these I will be buying more.


pink_goblet     Sun Feb 4 22:44:35 2018 UTC

True but most people need to get up early for work etc


ManBearPig1865     Sun Feb 4 22:49:11 2018 UTC

Well I need to be up later for work, somehow people forget that there are people who work hours other than 8-5. If I woke up at 6 I&#39;d be up for 6-7 hours before I needed to go in.


Ramon_98     Sun Feb 4 22:39:23 2018 UTC

Dogs wake up when the sun rises and go to sleep when it‚Äôs dark. Your roommate should not keep his dogs in just because you can‚Äôt adapt to a normal schedule. His dogs will go to sleep during the night and exercise during the day. When you adopt a night owl schedule you have to come to terms with the fact that your schedule will clash with most of society.


A_Rampaging_Hobo     Sun Feb 4 23:23:29 2018 UTC

&quot;Clash with most of society&quot;. Don&#39;t be so dramatic buddy.  It&#39;s the night shift that allows us to live so conveniently.

mighty_panders     Sun Feb 4 23:19:23 2018 UTC

Despite all the comments against you, you have a valid point. Dogs are not bound by our daily schedules and making them suffer to please another human would be cruel.


sweetcrosstatbro     Mon Feb 5 00:43:05 2018 UTC

A dog isn&#39;t suffering when you teach it not to bark at passing cars so it doesn&#39;t irritate your sleeping room mate. His room mate just needs to be a better dog owner.


justranoutoffanta     Sun Feb 4 23:39:21 2018 UTC

Lol why are you telling a human being to follow the schedule of a dog?


Todok5     Sun Feb 4 22:47:46 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not a choice. Some people do not adapt to what you call a regular schedule. 


Ramon_98     Sun Feb 4 22:51:21 2018 UTC

I understand that. Maybe you get a night shift and you have to sleep during the day. So you buy dark curtains and maybe some sound deadening foam for your roam. You don‚Äôt get mad at your roommate for letting out his dogs during the day.


Baldazar666     Sun Feb 4 23:08:25 2018 UTC

The whole idea of roommates is making compromises or each other. His roommate is an ass for not caring.


Ramon_98     Sun Feb 4 23:14:45 2018 UTC

To be fair to the roommate, it‚Äôs hard to compromise with dogs. You don‚Äôt let them out? They bark until you do? Or shit on your carpet. Or destroy your couch. It‚Äôs common courtesy to be quiet if someone else is sleeping but when it comes to animals, it‚Äôs hard to compromise with that.


marojelly     Sun Feb 4 23:19:53 2018 UTC

You can let them put for ten minutes. Dogs don&#39;t need to spend all day long outside 


kamahaoma     Sun Feb 4 23:47:09 2018 UTC

You don‚Äôt let them out? They bark until you do? Or shit on your carpet. Or destroy your couch.
Only if you didn&#39;t bother to train them.


ManBearPig1865     Sun Feb 4 22:41:35 2018 UTC

just because you can‚Äôt adapt to a normal schedule.
Fuck. You. 
I really hope at some point you get a job working second or third shift hours so you can try to &quot;adapt to a normal schedule&quot;.


Boombals     Sun Feb 4 23:08:51 2018 UTC

I mean to be fair it is a normal schedule for dogs


justranoutoffanta     Sun Feb 4 23:38:48 2018 UTC

Yeah if anything I just think it&#39;s funny that he&#39;s telling a human to adapt to the schedule of the species that humans bred into existence.
Like, why should a human need to follow the schedule of a dog? lol


xKaptnx     Mon Feb 5 00:20:56 2018 UTC

Isn&#39;t the point of this that you cant really change the dogs schedule as it&#39;s going to wake up and sleep at the same time everyday regardless of what you do? It&#39;s not about adapting to fit the dogs schedule because it&#39;s more important, it&#39;s a simple fact that it&#39;s not going to change its schedule and you&#39;re going to need to find a way to accommodate that regardless of whether we &quot;bred them into existence&quot; or not.


justranoutoffanta     Mon Feb 5 00:22:51 2018 UTC

Dogs can actually adapt to a human sleep cycle fairly easily because they often sleep for 50 to 75 percent of their day. Many dog breeds sleep 12-18 hours a day, so it&#39;s not hard for them to just move a couple of those hours around. They&#39;ll sleep whenever there&#39;s nothing to do, really.
Regardless, most humans sleep far less than dogs, which makes the whole comparison sort of irrelevant. Like, it&#39;s not incredibly hard to just get the dog to stop barking when someone is asleep. It&#39;s common courtesy.


Jenifarr     Sun Feb 4 23:45:46 2018 UTC

While I understand his point, I can relate to you much more. I worked straight nights for the last 14 years. The most recent 3 years have been 12-hour shifts.  (I finally got onto days this past November.) I have had to grit my teeth so many times to keep from shouting at my neighbours.  If I had a roommate with noisy dogs, I would hope they would try to do their best to mitigate the barking. I know letting my dog out in the middle of the night I have to keep her leashed so we can be out and back in quickly to avoid the inevitable bark-at-everything-that-rustles-in-the-dark moments.  Does he just put them outside for hours and leave them?


ibuprofen87     Sun Feb 4 23:48:19 2018 UTC

I think you&#39;re in the wrong here. A &quot;normal&quot; schedule can mean waking up anywhere from 6 to 9, and going to sleep between 9 and 12 (say). Which is why quiet hours are generally understood to be broader than the narrow conception you have of normalcy. 
Plus, humans take precedence over animals, within reason. 


imalittleC-3PO     Sun Feb 4 23:00:21 2018 UTC

I have to be up by 6:15 so I can be out the door by 6:30 for my 7am-5pm job. I take a 15-25 minute nap during my 30 minute lunch and get called lazy. The work culture we have in america is insane.


corporealmetacortex     Sun Feb 4 23:30:49 2018 UTC

Yeah. I&#39;ve got health issues, but I wanted a good career because I grew up poor and didn&#39;t want to deal with that shit anymore. I&#39;ve been in denial but everyday I get closer to realizing that I worked really hard towards a thing I&#39;m not certain I can do for long. I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m capable. I feel awful all the time. 
Someone please help me figure out how I can work 20-30 hours a week from home and not be poor?

Run an online store or business. Seriously, pick something that you&#39;re in love with, doesn&#39;t matter what it is. 
For an example let&#39;s pretend you really like rocks. Rocks are your jam and you just love collecting them and learning about them. 
First thing you do is look into who wants rocks and why. Is there a market for rocks? 
Hypothetically you find that yes, there is a large market for rocks. 
Next you find what kind of rocks you want to sell and in what way. You want to sell rare ones? Make a picture with them to sell as art? Sell collections? Find what interests you the most. 
Once you have a handle on who you&#39;re selling to and what you&#39;re selling, ya gotta find a way to get inventory. Wanna buy large lots? Want to thrift for them? Talk to rock suppliers? 
There&#39;s definitely a lot more to this than just this exercise, however if you do this and get excited about the idea of doing it, it&#39;s worth looking into.

Sleeping until 11 isn&#39;t inherently lazy.   I used to sleep until noon because I worked until 4am.

Does it count if I was up playing games until 4AM? 


CaptainVampireQueen     Sun Feb 4 23:38:52 2018 UTC

I used to argue about this with my Dad during summer break.
He&#39;d get up at 6am and wake me up to have me help him in the garden. Then he&#39;d take a nap from 10-2pm. In his mind you have to get up early in order to be productive.
What difference does it make if I sleep in till 10 and don&#39;t take a nap later? I&#39;ll be awake for the same amount of time during the day. I always had trouble falling asleep too so it&#39;d fucking tick me off. 


creaturecatzz     Mon Feb 5 00:06:21 2018 UTC

It&#39;s normally cooler in the mornings so you don&#39;t wear yourself out as much when doing physical things like helping in a garden. Think about it, if you had to run a mile would you rather it be at 6 in the morning when it&#39;s 50 degrees or at 1 in the afternoon when it&#39;s 85

&quot;Fucking tick me off&quot;


fadingsignal     Mon Feb 5 00:08:57 2018 UTC

This is a good outline of perspective hypocrisy.  If that person went to sleep at 3am, they only slept for 8 hours -- how is that lazy?  People still have a very distorted and judgmental view of sleep, and schedules, and assume that late risers went to bed at 10pm like they did, but just lied in bed for 13 hours, when in all likelihood they probably slept <em>less</em> than them.  So who&#39;s the lazy one?
It&#39;s been proven that &quot;night owls&quot; are busy-bodies who are generally productive into the late hours, so these people are usually working or creating late into the night, so the opposite of laziness is true.  The person who comes home from work, watches Netflix for 3 hrs, then sacks out at 10pm is much less productive than the person who worked for 17 hours straight and sacked out at 3am after they couldn&#39;t keep their eyes open any longer.
Some old (and current) tribes would just sleep when they are tired, hunt and work when they are rested.  This saw people dancing and working at all hours of the day and night, and was beneficial to the productivity and protection of the tribe.
Just a couple hundred years ago it was common in Europe for people to sleep in shifts; most would wake up in the middle of the night for a few hours to read, write, drink, socialize, then go back to sleep until the morning.  This has been evidenced by a number of journals/writings from the era.
How great would your life be if you slept when you were tired, and worked when you were rested?  Our perspective on productivity is still ingrained from needing to rise at dawn to start farm work during maximum light hours.
Source: I&#39;ve read a shit ton about sleep behavior, history, etc. because I&#39;m a night owl who has suffered the consequences of not having a rise-at-dawn schedule.


Youptube     Sun Feb 4 22:15:45 2018 UTC

Powernaps are underrated. Seriously, If I would take a two hour nap a day I would feel even more tired. A 10/15 min nap works even better than coffee in my opinion.


WeeziMonkey     Sun Feb 4 22:58:47 2018 UTC

A 10/15 min nap? It takes me like an hour to fall sleep at night, even when my body is tired. To me the concept of short daytime napping sounds impossible.


matt0707     Sun Feb 4 23:44:25 2018 UTC

This was me until about 6 months ago. Now I fall asleep in 30 seconds sometimes, at most a few minutes.
Limit your screen-time (phone/computer) in the hours before bed, or if you <em>have</em> to use electronics for work/school, use something like f.lux. Avoid caffeine late in the afternoon entirely. Eat dinner earlier.
I&#39;m not sure which of those 3 things fixed my sleep but I did them all at once and it was almost an instant fix. 


ChoppedNscrewdriver     Mon Feb 5 01:06:21 2018 UTC

F.lux is the shit. Seriously. I wish it came standard on computers. Wonderful program. 


rundmcarlson     Sun Feb 4 23:20:51 2018 UTC

You probably are not doing enough in a day to truly wear yourself out or are being too active close to bedtime. Although many people do experience this type of thing, its not normal operation to take that length of time to fall asleep.


xcrackpotfoxx     Sun Feb 4 23:35:31 2018 UTC

Tell that to my body. My brain won&#39;t fucking turn off at night half the time.


rundmcarlson     Sun Feb 4 23:41:30 2018 UTC

Ive also experienced this and had to change my lifestyle to sleep well. I would also wake up in the middle of the night because of a noise or discomfort and would be wide awake and unable to return to sleep. Doctor recommended working out during the day and staying off the computer an hour before bed and Ive been sleeping great since. 


SSBluthYacht     Sun Feb 4 23:55:32 2018 UTC

Were you working out in the evening previously? Or just not at all


xcrackpotfoxx     Mon Feb 5 00:28:57 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve been working out for about a year and a half and I do my best to stay off screens for an hour before bed. I feel tired then climb in bed and I just can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not much more complicated than closing your eyes, is it? Is there some switch to hit &#39;cause nobody told me about it.


KonyAteMyDog     Mon Feb 5 00:56:56 2018 UTC

Just do a system shutdown 


AnObsessedRedditor     Mon Feb 5 01:09:50 2018 UTC

Wish I could do that as well. It&#39;s not an hour for me generally, but it feels like it takes an eternity go fall asleep. 


talktochuckfinley     Sun Feb 4 22:56:01 2018 UTC

You&#39;re gonna think I&#39;m kidding, but try caffeine naps. Drink a cup of coffee (fairly quickly) and the nap 15-20 mins.  By the time the caffeine kicks in, you&#39;ll be waking up and super energized. Works better with caffeine pills cuz they&#39;re easier than slugging coffee. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/science-says-coffee-naps-are-better-non-caffeinated-ones-ncna797186">https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/science-says-coffee-naps-are-better-non-caffeinated-ones-ncna797186</a>


Rick_from_C137     Sun Feb 4 23:08:47 2018 UTC

Caffeine naps feel like a real life cheat code. Almost nobody I talk to has tried it.


justranoutoffanta     Sun Feb 4 23:48:55 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve heard of caffeine naps being fantastic, but it&#39;s hard for me to imagine doing it personally due to a few factors.
1) When I drink coffee, there&#39;s usually some sort of placebo effect that perks me up before the caffeine has truly had time to hit me.
2) I don&#39;t have much difficulty sleeping when I get tired at night, but I do have trouble sleeping in the daytime considering I&#39;ve usually already had coffee in the morning.
3) Even if I could sleep in the daytime, I feel that the timing would be very difficult. To chug coffee, ignore points 1 and 2 and then just snooze instantly sounds like a lot of logistics for someone like myself.
I have a few questions: do you drink coffee in the morning as well? Are you able to sleep while you already have caffeine working in your system? If so, why do you think that is?


Red_fire_soul16     Sun Feb 4 23:43:18 2018 UTC

ChoppedNscrewdriver     Mon Feb 5 01:07:10 2018 UTC

I adore this on the weekends. I get up early, get a ton of shit done, and after lunch I slurp some coffee and take a power nap. Does wonders. 


Bileeb     Sun Feb 4 23:09:39 2018 UTC

Wow you must have the gift of being able to fall asleep very easily. No matter how tired I am it takes me 2 to 3 hours each night to fall asleep. On a bad night up to 6 hours. 
My dream (pun intended) is to have that gift. So much wasted time. You‚Äôre a lucky person. I hope you appreciate it. 


ellismista     Sun Feb 4 23:17:47 2018 UTC

It seriously takes you that long to get to sleep??? I fall asleep in about 15 minutes on a normal night, and about 2 years ago, I used to fall asleep within literally 5 minutes of trying 


McLovin804     Sun Feb 4 23:22:00 2018 UTC

Takes me anywhere from 1-3 hours to fall asleep most nights.

drmantiss     Mon Feb 5 00:48:04 2018 UTC

So you just lay there for one to three hours? Or are you on your phone and shit?  If it‚Äôs taking you that long every night, you‚Äôre going to bed when you‚Äôre not tired. Getcha ass up, do shit, and go to sleep later. 


Zarainia     Mon Feb 5 00:52:07 2018 UTC

Well, maybe I&#39;m not tired now, but if I don&#39;t sleep enough I will be tired the next day.


Bileeb     Sun Feb 4 23:32:18 2018 UTC

Unfortunately yes. I spend the day feeling exhausted but when I‚Äôm lying there at night my mind is racing at 100mph and I‚Äôm full of energy. 


Red_fire_soul16     Sun Feb 4 23:44:37 2018 UTC

Probably been suggested before but perhaps you should look into meditation. I used to take a long time to go to bed but after practicing it a little I generally fall asleep in about 15 minutes. Great practice to quiet the mind. 


justranoutoffanta     Sun Feb 4 23:50:55 2018 UTC

It&#39;s usually good to just get out of bed if you feel that productive energy and you can&#39;t sleep. If you lay in bed every night fully awake and thinking about a million things, your mind won&#39;t associate your bed with sleep as much and it will be harder to feel that &quot;sleep pressure&quot; come over you.

You seem to be at a point where you feel that changing your relationship with sleep is impossible. Are you certain that there&#39;s nothing you could change about your day that would help you sleep later?


canopyman     Sun Feb 4 23:48:28 2018 UTC

The thing is with power naps is I only have the commitment to do them during finals week (under pressure). Other normal days of the week, my body just says ‚Äúbruhh why sleep 15 minutes when you can sleep for like an hour!! This bed is also super comfy and warm‚Äù so I end up sleeping an hour or two.
I have no idea how to get over this, if you have any advice then help me please!


1pt21jigawatt     Sun Feb 4 23:16:30 2018 UTC

People who call you lazy for sleeping are just jealous because their life sucks


justranoutoffanta     Sun Feb 4 23:54:27 2018 UTC

Ehh honestly I see people doing that for multiple reasons. Sometimes there are people who complain about how their life never seems to improve or come together, but then you see their sleep schedule (often from depression) keeping them from really making any productive use of their day.
There are plenty of people who are genuinely lazy, sleep all day, and feel bad/guilty about it because they know what&#39;s holding them back from their true goals and desires.


Lacia10aggie     Mon Feb 5 00:01:16 2018 UTC

Can confirm. First thought seeing this was  ‚Äú9am is your early option?!? grumble grumble must be nice...‚Äù I am a sleep-deprived mom and get maybe 3 hours of sleep a night and was just insanely jealous that other people get the option of sleeping in.

Xerxes80     Mon Feb 5 00:54:25 2018 UTC

For a good month last year in college, my sleep schedule was 10 pm to 5 am. I couldn&#39;t stay up later than 10 pm for some reason so I had to do my homework in the morning because my regular sleep schedule was something like 1 am - 10 am. It was horrible 


DrCosmo91     Sun Feb 4 22:50:58 2018 UTC

Used to have a job where I woke up at 5am.  Even on days off I could NOT sleep past 5 am.  10pm was bed.  Next job was from 5pm to 11pm and then I couldn&#39;t wake up before 3pm.  Now I am unemployed and sleep from 8am-6pm and maybe also nap from 8-10pm.  I am awake from 9pm to 8am, usually.  
Circadian rhythm is weird.


throwaway094850394     Mon Feb 5 00:59:48 2018 UTC

Do you think your unemployment would end sooner if you were awake during normal business hours for interviews, etc.?


RPFM     Sun Feb 4 22:50:34 2018 UTC

No, it doesn&#39;t. Sounds healthier.


peypeyy     Sun Feb 4 22:54:04 2018 UTC

What the fuck that&#39;s exactly what I did today and I never take naps. 


ShadierSean     Sun Feb 4 22:58:37 2018 UTC

Ironically enough, I&#39;m living this very thing today.  Yesterday, I overslept by 3 hours.  Today, I only got 6 hours of sleep...but have been tired all day, so I ended up taking a 3 hour nap.
Equally frustrated at the loss of 3 hours each day.


KitKeating     Sun Feb 4 23:20:58 2018 UTC

I got up at 9:30, looked around for a while, and took the dog back to bed. Slept until 11:30. Happy. SUNDAAAAAAY!


thedeadlysheep     Sun Feb 4 22:55:26 2018 UTC

I nwver get that. Yes I sleep in until 1 pm on sundays, my parents give me shit for that but then get tired at 3pm and go to take a nap


The_Wack_Knight     Sun Feb 4 20:30:19 2018 UTC

9AM IS sleeping in for me. I dont recall the last time I actually legit slept until 9AM, unless I went to sleep at 4AM. If I slept until 9AM I would not only NOT need a nap during the day, I would more than likely be up that next night until the wee hours because I woke up so late.


Immature_bird     Sun Feb 4 22:40:24 2018 UTC

When do you usually go to bed at night though? 


Percehh     Sun Feb 4 22:54:19 2018 UTC

I try to be in bed by 9.30 usually up at 5.30, I also try not to drink alcohol at night time too and strictly day drink to keep my sleep schedule. 


N-methylamph     Sun Feb 4 23:18:18 2018 UTC

Damn that&#39;s a perfect excuse to day drink, thank you for that one.


snowboard44     Sun Feb 4 23:55:58 2018 UTC

Nice, my sleep rules are the complete opposite


The_Wack_Knight     Sun Feb 4 23:09:02 2018 UTC

Somewhere around midnight usually, but I am old now. 


Immature_bird     Mon Feb 5 00:14:01 2018 UTC

Well I mean here&#39;s the answer to your magical power. You get 8 hours of sleep on a daily basis. Makes a lot of sense why you can&#39;t sleep past 8


The_Wack_Knight     Mon Feb 5 00:21:40 2018 UTC

I agree. If people go to sleep at a reasonable time, they wake up at a reasonable time. I wake up at 0530 actually, so five and a half hours daily is enough for me. Even on the weekends when I stay up until 2 or 3 I still cant wake up at 9.


MightyMille     Sun Feb 4 22:55:49 2018 UTC

Damn, I wish I could sleep in until 9 am, but my son wakes me up at 7 am. Actually, I should be sleeping right now. 


Grammareyetwitch     Mon Feb 5 00:05:42 2018 UTC

Mine sleeps til 930. However, she also likes to stay up until 11 some nights.


zenethra     Sun Feb 4 23:01:58 2018 UTC

the latter was literally my day today. i guarantee it&#39;s just as lazy. i picked up delivery pizza at 4pm in pajamas.


thebruiser_     Sun Feb 4 23:14:28 2018 UTC

This is exactly what I do on my days off. I wake up around 7 or so, feed that cat and myself, browse Reddit and fall back asleep until 1. 
Might be due to the fact I haven&#39;t seen the sun in 4 weeks and I have depression that gets 10x worse in the winter.


IChooseTheNap     Sun Feb 4 23:19:02 2018 UTC

Well guess which one I prefer


krichnard     Sun Feb 4 23:28:44 2018 UTC

Waking up at 9AM sounds lazy to me! <sup>im</sup> <sup>actually</sup> <sup>jealous<sup>.</sup></sup>


justranoutoffanta     Mon Feb 5 00:01:29 2018 UTC

Honestly the sun does give off some healthy energy for the body and being up earlier in the morning can often feel more positive and productive for that very reason.
Obviously some people aren&#39;t able to have a normal sleep schedule due to other factors, but you can&#39;t really deny that being up with the sun is a very special energy.
Being a night owl has its own benefits and unique energy on life/thoughts, but doing it your whole life just won&#39;t be as rejuvenating from a scientific standpoint.


Lington     Mon Feb 5 00:01:59 2018 UTC

It doesn&#39;t sound lazy to me! 
Source: I can sleep till 1 if I have nothing going on 


farineziq     Mon Feb 5 00:12:30 2018 UTC

sleeping for 2 hours is more than a nap


jrc000     Mon Feb 5 00:19:25 2018 UTC

This is the difference between my boyfriend and I. He gets up at the ass crack of dawn and goes to the gym, while I stay in bed for a couple hours. Then later he takes a nap while I can stay up all day. 


ineverheardthat     Mon Feb 5 00:24:27 2018 UTC

Lol waking up at 9 is pretty fuckin lazy too. Although to be fair I got out of bed at noon today. 


TeemusSALAMI     Mon Feb 5 00:28:50 2018 UTC

My thing used to be waking up at four thirty or five am and taking a two to three hour nap around 2-3. People were so impressed that I woke up before the sun they totally ignored that I shut myself off for a couple of hours in the middle of the day. 


LackingCreativityATM     Mon Feb 5 00:29:44 2018 UTC

Man, I wish I could sleep in til 9.  Hell, I&#39;d take 7 if my kids would allow it.


Mshkin57     Mon Feb 5 00:30:08 2018 UTC

I wish my body would let me do either. If it&#39;s light out, I can&#39;t sleep, no matter what.


miparasito     Mon Feb 5 00:34:02 2018 UTC

One of my friends is a smug morning person who gets up by six. But over the years I‚Äôve realized that she takes frequent long naps and goes to bed by 8:00 most nights. I also maintain that any nap she takes before noon should count as going back to bed.


Mandaface     Mon Feb 5 00:38:27 2018 UTC

Step dad used to harp on me for sleeping till noon. Meanwhile he got up at 6am, sat on his ass all day and napped all afternoon. What&#39;s the difference!


Neon_Shaman     Mon Feb 5 00:39:55 2018 UTC

It sounds lazy if you went to bed at 10pm but if it was 3am hardly lazy.


ManDragonA     Mon Feb 5 00:40:19 2018 UTC

Never limit yourself to just one nap a day.


SphmrSlmp     Mon Feb 5 00:48:01 2018 UTC

That&#39;s the same as working several hours overtime and nobody bats an eye. But come in 15 minutes late and everybody loses their mind.


rymden_viking     Mon Feb 5 00:55:48 2018 UTC

I wake up at 5 every morning for work, and sleep in to a nice 6 am on the weekends.


gretamine     Mon Feb 5 01:07:28 2018 UTC

I didn&#39;t even know people woke up before noon unless they were being forced to tbh. 


Thebuttdoctor     Mon Feb 5 01:10:16 2018 UTC

I think the difference is the intention and self control.
When i sleep till 11-12 I feel like it wasnt on purpose i was just tired, but if i wake up at like 7-8 and then nap at like 12-1 it feels like i have taken responsibility and control of my bodies cycle to my advantage. 


Lamnent     Mon Feb 5 01:17:42 2018 UTC

My girlfriend kinda does this, she doesn&#39;t shame me or anything it&#39;s just how our days work out.  I work 3rds and sometimes end up sleeping 9-11hrs if I&#39;ve got nothing to do and I feel bad for it when I get, aw man, she went to bed at 1am and woke up at 7am...  Then remember she just woke up from her nap when she fell asleep at 4:30pm and it&#39;s now 9.  lol


Orwellian1     Sun Feb 4 22:48:04 2018 UTC

2hrs is getting dangerously close to losing the &quot;nap&quot; designation. 


alapleno     Mon Feb 5 00:25:10 2018 UTC

Seriously. There have been weeks where I got 3 hours a night.


resolvetochange     Sun Feb 4 23:33:18 2018 UTC

It&#39;s about control. Someone choosing to take a nap in the day is because they made a choice, someone sleeping in is because they lack motivation to get up or have made choices that led to a bad sleep schedule.
Someone who sleeps in a single day of the week isn&#39;t seen the same as someone who sleeps in everyday.


ZeroG1515     Mon Feb 5 00:22:10 2018 UTC

Both sound very lazy to me


Wartrack     Sun Feb 4 22:26:00 2018 UTC

Because at least you tried. 


JG_Pudge     Sun Feb 4 22:56:18 2018 UTC

Reading all of these times gets me jealous. My job has me up at 4:30am and I go to bed around 10pm. 


donnie1581     Sun Feb 4 22:58:50 2018 UTC

What if you get up at 9 and take a nap at 11?


tnharwal55     Sun Feb 4 23:00:11 2018 UTC

No it doesn&#39;t. 


_u_WereTheFrozenOne     Sun Feb 4 23:01:50 2018 UTC

Does it?


nelska     Sun Feb 4 23:04:57 2018 UTC

I do everyday.. but I also work second shift. so.


sindoe     Sun Feb 4 23:16:25 2018 UTC

I&#39;m keep waking up at 5am on my days off and can&#39;t go back to sleep it&#39;s actually starting to suck


Dica92     Sun Feb 4 23:18:17 2018 UTC

That&#39;s assuming you got shit done in that two hour window


YuriTreychenko     Sun Feb 4 23:24:30 2018 UTC

Just woke up at 10am. For some reason, I feel like I let myself down if I don&#39;t wake up at 8 or less.


Riael     Sun Feb 4 23:25:52 2018 UTC

I&#39;ll keep waking up at 13 tyvm.


INTP-02     Sun Feb 4 23:26:28 2018 UTC

Laziness is a good thing, it motivates new tech to do things in an easier way.


BrotherModi     Sun Feb 4 23:29:28 2018 UTC

Brother walrus I know you read this too. 


voidxleech     Sun Feb 4 23:29:37 2018 UTC

fucking story of my life.


FormaldehydeX     Sun Feb 4 23:30:12 2018 UTC

I do this,every day without fail. Sometimes i take a second nap later on too


Tacos2night     Sun Feb 4 23:33:09 2018 UTC

Waking up at 9 is pretty freaking lazy tbh.


CorvoLP     Sun Feb 4 23:34:08 2018 UTC

not if you get out of work at 2 and get home at 2:30


TheUnstopableForce     Sun Feb 4 23:36:00 2018 UTC

You cant sleep in if you never wake up


draculas_brother     Sun Feb 4 23:36:58 2018 UTC

My parents criticize me for sleeping in on the weekends and then they take 3 hour naps in the afternoon. ITS LIKE, CMON GUYS GIVE ME A BREAKKKK


LeKanePetit     Sun Feb 4 23:39:56 2018 UTC

The past few weeks I‚Äôve been sleeping at 2/3am and waking up at 11am. It sucks but also feels too good... 


Kylebeast420     Sun Feb 4 23:41:34 2018 UTC

At 20 11am all day, at 40 I will take the nap.


RollMeInClover     Sun Feb 4 23:41:37 2018 UTC

Shit, I wake up at 7:30 every morning, take meds, smoke, and go back to bed until HOPEFULLY 10 or 10:30. Don&#39;t usually get to bed until 2am, so there&#39;s that...


Oconitnitsua     Sun Feb 4 23:41:59 2018 UTC

What about waking up at 9am, but not getting out of bed until 11 cause that‚Äôs when the hunger/need to pee overwhelms you? 


Frogcamo     Sun Feb 4 23:41:59 2018 UTC

People get up earlier than 11?


WolfofNothing     Sun Feb 4 23:42:20 2018 UTC

11am? You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers! Try 2pm


naiarala     Sun Feb 4 23:42:40 2018 UTC

Measuring sleep is counterproductive. Doesn&#39;t matter when you wake up or fell asleep as long as you are well rested. Putting numbers to it ain&#39;t gonna do any good. 


H20fearsme     Sun Feb 4 23:44:02 2018 UTC

Excellent options either way


sekazi     Sun Feb 4 23:47:18 2018 UTC

I wish I could sleep until 9 AM. I am up at 6 AM and out the door before 6:30 AM then get home around 6 PM then go to bed around 11:30 PM.


dinngoe     Sun Feb 4 23:47:31 2018 UTC

11am isn&#39;t sleeping in.  I sleep till 2pm most days.


itsmycreed     Sun Feb 4 23:49:26 2018 UTC

Both sound lazy as fuck


madmenyo     Sun Feb 4 23:50:54 2018 UTC

How about going to bed 4 hours earlier or getting up 4 hours later?


ajwhitely     Sun Feb 4 23:54:03 2018 UTC

Guess I&#39;m lazy then. It&#39;s 10:55am here, Iiterally just woke up but still in bed though :P


BlistersOnMySisters     Sun Feb 4 23:54:53 2018 UTC

It definitely is.


mechanical_animal     Sun Feb 4 23:58:41 2018 UTC

I am scared to take naps because I can easily deviate to a daytime sleep cycle and it&#39;s so hard to revert.


MemphisWords     Sun Feb 4 23:58:55 2018 UTC

What beautiful life are you living where you can wake up at 9 everyday?


thundar00     Mon Feb 5 00:00:07 2018 UTC

Why not sleep until 9am then take a 2 hour nap??


overzeetop     Mon Feb 5 00:00:17 2018 UTC

Corollary: Getting to work at 6:30am and knocking off &quot;early&quot; at 4pm makes you look like a slacker, but showing up at 9 and &quot;staying late&quot; until 6 makes you seem really dedicated.  


irandom97     Mon Feb 5 00:04:22 2018 UTC

What about sleeping until 11am and then taking a 5 hour nap at 2pm and then go to bed at 9pm and wake up at 11am? Is that bad? 


Arnumor     Mon Feb 5 00:04:51 2018 UTC

I constantly struggle with my sleep schedule. My family has a history of depression and bipolar disorder, although I haven&#39;t specifically been diagnosed with either.
I always have trouble getting to sleep, and it seems as though every time I do manage to get into a normal sleep schedule, I end up having gut issues flare up and ruin it, so I fall right back into the rut.
Lately, it&#39;s been not falling asleep until 8-9am despite going to bed anywhere from 3am to 5am, and then sleeping until 5pm. Had another flare last night, so the discomfort kept me from getting any sleep until just past noon. I only got up by 5pm this time because I woke in a flop sweat, and couldn&#39;t stand it, so I got up to shower.
I tend to wake up repeatedly when I&#39;m exhausted, and I have stressful dreams when my guts are messed up. Great combination. 


Prsop2000     Mon Feb 5 00:05:59 2018 UTC

I just can‚Äôt sleep past 9 for some reason. If I force myself to stay in bed past 11 I get a headache.


Limond     Mon Feb 5 00:06:59 2018 UTC

I woke up at 2 am, reddited in bed till around 5. Then took 2 naps today.


woht24     Mon Feb 5 00:07:27 2018 UTC

I disagree.


TheInebriatedKraken     Mon Feb 5 00:13:20 2018 UTC

TIL that I&#39;m scum for not having a &quot;normal&quot; sleep schedule. 


pototo_fries     Mon Feb 5 00:13:20 2018 UTC

I slept til 130 today. Idc. Fight me!  &gt;:)


rondeline     Mon Feb 5 00:14:28 2018 UTC

Damn. Mexicans are geniuses. 


alexkunk     Mon Feb 5 00:14:55 2018 UTC

Who sleeps till 9???


birbang     Mon Feb 5 00:17:51 2018 UTC

The second one in my opinion sounds lazier.


CowHasNips     Mon Feb 5 00:18:47 2018 UTC

I stayed in bed till 3pm because i had a fucked up dream and was depressed.


MrTopHatMan90     Mon Feb 5 00:23:49 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve started waking up at 7 and don&#39;t say I get up at 12


tigger_tam     Mon Feb 5 00:26:43 2018 UTC

Tbf, the nap later could be recouping energy lost from a productive morning.


Young_sims     Mon Feb 5 00:33:57 2018 UTC

Yo


Crosseyeaccount     Mon Feb 5 00:34:00 2018 UTC

I consider getting up at 11 as early.


Kbotonline     Mon Feb 5 00:34:34 2018 UTC

Such is my life. Not sure how I haven‚Äôt been fired yet


Herald-Mage_Elspeth     Mon Feb 5 00:37:04 2018 UTC

Yesterday morning I was complaining when my bf was awake at 9 after going to bed at 3. I went to bed at 12 and was still tired but we got up. 6 pm, guess who was taking a nap? You guessed it. He slept until 10 and then was up until 2. I was in bed at 12 again. 


Shinokiba-     Mon Feb 5 00:37:06 2018 UTC

I get up at freaking 5! In fact, I am about to go to bed. 


Killer_Tomato     Mon Feb 5 00:39:44 2018 UTC

I knew a guy who was convinced he worked harder than anyone else because he woke up at 4 am to go to work. I asked him about second or third shift and he said they get to sleep later even if they did the same construction job he did. 


Kiss-CSGO     Mon Feb 5 00:41:53 2018 UTC

waking up at 1pm and sleeping at 4 am (9 hrs of sleep) sounds lazier than waling up at 8 am and sleeping at 11 pm (9 hrs of sleep) 


ElegantWaste     Mon Feb 5 00:42:19 2018 UTC

I guess it&#39;s a good thing I slept in until 5:25 pm today. I got all of tonight&#39;s sleeping done so I&#39;m ahead of the game.


mkhnghn     Mon Feb 5 00:44:13 2018 UTC

I disagree. Who takes a 2 hour nap during the day? That sounds very lazy. Especially if you only got up at 9 am.
Now, I do think people who sleep in til 11 but don&#39;t go to be til 3am get a lousy rep. No different than going to bed at 10 at getting up at 6.


Smitty907     Mon Feb 5 00:46:37 2018 UTC

Just woke up but let me get back to you after my nap thx 


vacattack     Mon Feb 5 00:46:56 2018 UTC

Hope you have a good nap my dude!


KansasChunkyChick     Mon Feb 5 00:50:36 2018 UTC

Every time I try to  take a short nap, even with an alarm. I sleep for about 5 hours 


DragonTamerMCT     Mon Feb 5 00:51:03 2018 UTC

Why is sleeping late lazy? I never understood this... some people work weird shifts, are part time, go on passive income, have the day off, etc... 
Some people just stay up late. What the fuck is the difference between going to bed at 9pm and waking up at 5am, and going to bed at 4am and waking up at 11am? 


iGalaxy_     Mon Feb 5 00:52:32 2018 UTC

Still better than 5-5 sleep at 5am wake at 5 pm


OzzieBloke777     Mon Feb 5 00:52:58 2018 UTC

I like how someone out there thinks sleeping in until 9am isn&#39;t already being lazy...


chris_0909     Mon Feb 5 00:53:54 2018 UTC

Why does it matter what time you wake up? If I sleep 8 hours from 4AM to noon, why is that lazy? I‚Äôm awake 16 hours still, go to work shortly after waking up and then do everything else after. Why do I get judged when my sleep time is just shifted, not longer!


spicy_af_69     Mon Feb 5 00:54:45 2018 UTC

Sleeping in? That&#39;s cute. Have a kid, you won&#39;t be doing that anymore. 


tinacat933     Mon Feb 5 01:08:27 2018 UTC

Are we supposed to feel bad for you?


drunxor     Mon Feb 5 00:58:15 2018 UTC

TIL 11am is sleeping in and naps aren&#39;t lazy


Xamry14     Mon Feb 5 00:58:45 2018 UTC

And its always lazy to sleep past noon no matter how late you stay up.
Life of the night shift adult.  My MIL used to wake me up at 7-10 am after going to bed at 5 am right after work.  This was while my husband was also in the hospital and I was sleeping on the recliner next to him so in addition to the small amount of sleep, I got crappy sleep too.  
But according to her, it was time to wake up and I needed to stop being lazy.....


WilliamEDodd     Mon Feb 5 01:00:45 2018 UTC

9am is sleeping in. 


Biddyearlyman     Mon Feb 5 01:00:54 2018 UTC

If you&#39;re not up before the sun you have failed as a human being!


corruptrevolutionary     Mon Feb 5 01:04:52 2018 UTC

Awaking up at 9 is super late/lazy and a 2 hour nap is massive. What‚Äôs going on, buddy? How you feeling?


kerodon     Mon Feb 5 01:05:09 2018 UTC

Just polyphasic things.
