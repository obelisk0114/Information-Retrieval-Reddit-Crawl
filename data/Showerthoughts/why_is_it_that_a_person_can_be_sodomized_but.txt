For real though, there are sodomites and catamites. Sodomites do the buttfucking. Catamites are the ones receiving the buttfucking.

Sodomized is just short for sodomandgomorrahed.

Gomorrahed is the STD you get after being sodomized.

Thank you. Now every time I see Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy I will think of an STD.
