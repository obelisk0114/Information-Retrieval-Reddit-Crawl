Soap gets dirty as it picks up particulates. The group would only get cleaned if the soapy patch was then scrubbed.

But if you drop the soap you most likely have wet hands. So the soap will get wet too. And since you haven’t dropped a perfectly rectangular soap bar in a 90° angle towards the ground it’ll slide around on the floor a bit. Ergo, it’ll do both.

I&#39;m not washing the towel! The towel washes me. What&#39;s next? You gonna wash a bar of soap!?
