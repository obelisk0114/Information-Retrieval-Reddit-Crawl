If crashing in Cars is a season ending career, do they break their legs and arms?

I thought this exact shit when watching Cars 3 last night... and I didn&#39;t know where to put it.

Track and field. Since Cars are the people and the training regiments they run wouldn’t work on real cars. Putting your car on a treadmill wouldn’t help it go faster as illustrated in Cars 3.
