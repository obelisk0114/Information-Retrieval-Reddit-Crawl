Sometimes, I feel like an NPC in my own life. 


StarvedToaster     Sun Feb 4 06:26:05 2018 UTC

You too?


MillionsofSpiders     Sun Feb 4 01:00:45 2018 UTC

I’m the dmpc in other peoples lives. I come out of nowhere unwanted, make it all about me, become hated by all then refuse to die. 


Onetimehelper     Sun Feb 4 01:58:42 2018 UTC

I really hope the dragonborn doesn&#39;t show up anytime soon. 


bettazg28     Sun Feb 4 04:14:24 2018 UTC

Remember, if you see them quicksaving....run.

I used to be an adventurer like you until you killed the entire town. 


BaKdGoOdZ0203     Sun Feb 4 02:20:48 2018 UTC

I hope I&#39;m not some stupid side mission. Most likely am tho. 


UniversDesAmes     Sun Feb 4 07:28:01 2018 UTC

You&#39;re the person on reddit whose comment I&#39;ll reply to before I fall asleep


BaKdGoOdZ0203     Sun Feb 4 16:49:41 2018 UTC

You&#39;re a random comment reply in my inbox when I woke up and checked reddit this morning. 


PiksilDemon     Sun Feb 4 02:55:21 2018 UTC

this is funny because i live my life like a game. every time im asked to do something i treat it like a quest and think of the pros and cons of doing it and not doing it


janvanderwal     Sun Feb 4 05:45:16 2018 UTC

Pros: I get shit and XP
Cons: It might be boring


Cthulhlou     Sun Feb 4 07:40:11 2018 UTC

Life is pvp

I believe the term is sondering, and if this fills you with low key existential dread, you know why religion is so popular.


Jimmigill     Sun Feb 4 10:52:47 2018 UTC

<a href="/r/outside" rel="nofollow">/r/outside</a> put it best. &quot;There are no NPCs. Aside from animals, everybody is a &#39;player&#39;.&quot;


Ratox     Sun Feb 4 13:10:24 2018 UTC

I work in a hypermarket. 
Yep.


dogslovemebest     Sun Feb 4 19:54:38 2018 UTC

That explains why I just stay in my room until other people interact with me


phrogwing     Sun Feb 4 07:30:07 2018 UTC

There are no other people&#39;s lives.


indominus_prime     Sun Feb 4 12:10:57 2018 UTC

Waking up = respawning


Robert927     Sun Feb 4 13:51:58 2018 UTC

No you&#39;re not dying, you&#39;re just sleeping, until that shop opens up at 9 AM... so that you can legally buy everything and definetly not steal anything 


RockieRockie     Sun Feb 4 13:05:49 2018 UTC

I feel dumb for asking it but what is NPC ?


Big_comrade     Sun Feb 4 13:36:09 2018 UTC

Non-player character; The characters that aren&#39;t you in video games/ characters not controlled by a player. 


DXent     Sun Feb 4 20:29:14 2018 UTC

R/outside


Venrexx     Sun Feb 4 21:35:21 2018 UTC

Here&#39;s an interesting thought: Look at any pictures you took out in public, whether it be of friends, family, or even just random places. Now think of all the people in the background of the photo. That happens to everyone, most likely including you. Imagine how many photos you exist in that you will never know about, or never see.


fatherfuckingfuck     Sun Feb 4 21:36:30 2018 UTC

I work at an ice rink where pictures are often taken. I think about this a lot when I’m skating around for hours. 


Venrexx     Sun Feb 4 22:14:24 2018 UTC

This would be especially relevant to someone driving a Zamboni seeing as there are lots of people who like taking pictures and videos of those in motion.


fatherfuckingfuck     Sun Feb 4 22:15:52 2018 UTC

They are pretty neat to watch! I’ve grown accustomed to it, but as a child it was awesome! Guests are always trying to touch the ice scraper 


Venrexx     Sun Feb 4 22:19:50 2018 UTC

When I was a child I was awe-struck at the sight of this magical machine that could clean and fix the ice in one pass. It was amazing! Being Canadian though, you see them a heck of a lot, and I did work at an arena when I was younger, so it became a pretty normal thing pretty quickly, but they are still cool.
