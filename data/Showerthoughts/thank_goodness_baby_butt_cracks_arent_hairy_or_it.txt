Hey, they wash the civet crap off the beans. At least its not <a href="https://www.thailandunique.com/bug-a-poop-tea" rel="nofollow">Bugapoop Tea</a>, where the tea is the poop.

Preschool teacher here. Our playground has sand. Itâ€™s inevitable that sand gets into their diapers (as well as their hair, jacket hoods, and everywhere else) so after their time outside we come in and I do a diaper check. I have changed hundreds of diapers but poop mixed with sand is something I still canâ€™t get over.

Why are preschoolers wearing diapers? Doesn&#39;t preschool start at or around 3 years old?

Preschool can be infants and up

I teach 18-24 months, and while itâ€™s not preschool in the sense you may think of , itâ€™s more teaching social skills and basic manners (using our words to voice frustration, encouraging sharing, the works), and other things like teaching them to sit in their chair during snack, a circle time which consists of exposing them to colors, letters and other basic things (which is 5 min max because theyâ€™re so young) etc. My school is for aged 6 weeks to 12 years.

It&#39;s like cleaning peanut butter out of a shag carpet

Tell me about it! I take care of the elderly that often wear diapers, not only do they have hairy bums, no one shaves their pubes &amp; if you aren&#39;t mobile you lay on your back or with your bum in a chair meaning when you poop which is mostly from assistance with laxatives because you aren&#39;t mobile it is extremely soft &amp; shoots to the front more so for a women &amp; gets trapped in all the hair. It is one of the hardest things I&#39;ve clean in my career by far. Not to mention you feel awful if they still have feeling or don&#39;t because eventually you have to pull the hair out to clean it properly not pull off the skin &amp; you just imagine how much it must hurt, &amp; it takes forever especially if your being gentle which I always try very hard to be.
I have had one client that let us shave her to make things easier, most patients wouldn&#39;t want you too or if you ask their family they don&#39;t want you too, especially in nursing homes they are always so busy they think it would take more time to shave down some of the hair than to clean the mess, but it would save loads of time on cleaning up bms even if you only shaved once a month.
Oh the bushes I have seen, on men &amp; women.
