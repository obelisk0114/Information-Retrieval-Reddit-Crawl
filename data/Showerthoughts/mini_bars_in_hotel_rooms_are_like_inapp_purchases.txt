Priced like them too.


TheEXPGrind     Sun Feb 4 20:36:12 2018 UTC

But with no 20% bonus if you spend $99.99


goldfishpaws     Sun Feb 4 21:04:49 2018 UTC

$99.99 of minibar is enough to get you mildly tipsy


Zurich0825     Sun Feb 4 14:19:04 2018 UTC

But i can go outside, buy the same stuff way cheaper and eat it in the hotel room. 


-AdamTheGreat-     Sun Feb 4 15:10:41 2018 UTC

Thatâ€™s called cheating. ðŸ˜‚

Mutually exclusive

Buying in game items on the black market

But you will get banned from the server...


jayvil     Sun Feb 4 13:56:34 2018 UTC

With microtransactions


_Vitriol     Sun Feb 4 13:33:58 2018 UTC

A fully realized a 3D world? Free.<br/>Wearing a pink hat in said world? $5.


DarkDoesThings     Sun Feb 4 20:40:44 2018 UTC

Can confirm. Minibar says EA on it.


d2181     Sun Feb 4 20:52:07 2018 UTC

MinEA bar

App- short for apartment (because it&#39;s like a short term apartment)


sutree1     Sun Feb 4 13:42:45 2018 UTC

Betcha can&#39;t have just one?


Gallade0475     Sun Feb 4 19:17:38 2018 UTC

I love that sense of pride and accomplishment 


Moose_Overlord     Sun Feb 4 19:19:03 2018 UTC

Not really.
I can buy a $1 Snickers bar at the corner store and replace it with the $18 Snickers bar in the hotel room.  No one&#39;s the wiser.
You can&#39;t buy in-app purchases anywhere else but the app.


shub1000young     Sun Feb 4 21:46:53 2018 UTC

Half of them have weight sensors and charge you when something is removed.


thisguyknowswhtsup     Sun Feb 4 17:34:54 2018 UTC

Absolutely, they are both leading causes of a broken phone.


shub1000young     Sun Feb 4 21:45:59 2018 UTC

If you are on expenses it is the season pass.


damojr     Sun Feb 4 21:22:49 2018 UTC

Except I can&#39;t refill the empty app bottles with water/tea and not pay for them. 


CommunistFesto     Sun Feb 4 23:14:51 2018 UTC

And you can turn them off too


nak131     Mon Feb 5 01:03:02 2018 UTC

In-app purchases are like mini bars in hotel rooms


Qwikskoupa69     Sun Feb 4 14:13:56 2018 UTC

And the games are made by EA
