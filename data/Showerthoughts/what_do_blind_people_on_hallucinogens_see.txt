Holy shit I never realized how much I needed to know the answer to this question till now.

This was last month but the thread links to a number of other links

I dunno, maybe they get auditory hallucinations? I hope someone answers. 


A_Tricky_one     Mon Feb 5 00:54:58 2018 UTC

Somebody once asked this in AskReddit


TheQuickSilver099     Sun Feb 4 10:12:47 2018 UTC

Some crazy ass braille. 
No really, different blind people have different problems so it would depend on the situation. If the rods and cones dont work at all, then nothing is &quot;seen&quot;. Then you get all metaphysical with the inagination stuff. I think it would be similar to a trip in that the mind wonders and the visual parts are present, but pethaps the visual parts are the brains response to light as well, in which case there would be nothing. I DONT KNOW!

Eat acid and sit in complete darkness, you‚Äôll think ‚Äúshit, I must be sober‚Äù
Then the lights come on and you realize that‚Äôs not the case


MathsandLSD     Sun Feb 4 20:41:20 2018 UTC

That is not true in the slightest.


afticansponsorchild     Sun Feb 4 20:46:35 2018 UTC

This person is correct üëÜyou get all the geometric patterns when you close your eyes and all sorts of visuals. Sensory deprivation makes it more Visual because your tripping brain is trying to fill the void.


MathsandLSD     Sun Feb 4 20:49:37 2018 UTC

I mean the Terence McKenna method for taking shrooms is literally to sit in silent darkness.


afticansponsorchild     Sun Feb 4 20:55:39 2018 UTC

I like to do that sometimes. I went swimming once and it was pretty cool though 


MathsandLSD     Sun Feb 4 20:59:25 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve tried low dose truffles but it was pretty underwhelming. Didn&#39;t have the best setting though. Have yet to try a proper dose of shrooms.


Jeffryansom     Sun Feb 4 12:11:15 2018 UTC

Blind people, like sighted people, report auditory, olfactory, gustatory and tactile hallucinations, but they do so at a higher rate. I&#39;ve just found a remarkable 1963 study from the Archives of Opthalmology in which 24 blind participants took LSD to see if they could experience visual hallucinations.


Krenth_KH     Sun Feb 4 14:26:09 2018 UTC

&quot;Yeah, great idea! Lets give some blind wankers some LSD and see what happens...&quot; Who the hell thought of this???


DEEGOBOOSTER     Sun Feb 4 14:49:30 2018 UTC

Who wouldn‚Äôt want to know? If you‚Äôve got willing participants who are properly briefed where‚Äôs the problem?


ghoul__     Sun Feb 4 17:43:54 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t see the issue here. It&#39;s a perfectly good research topic and LSD is generally safe, especially under observation in controlled settings.


FatherUncleDad     Sun Feb 4 14:54:10 2018 UTC

The answer people are looking for most when asking this kind of question is usually in regards to people who are COMPLETELY blind and have been so since birth.  I&#39;ll give 2 extreme examples, and answer both:
Example 1:  The person is blind due to a defect in the eye or optical nerve.  The eye is just a receiver, the brain is what actually &quot;sees&quot; or generates the image of what the eye is detecting.  In this case, the &quot;seeing&quot; part of the brain is functioning, it just isn&#39;t getting a signal. These people will go around seeing blackness as there is no input signal coming through (just as would be for you standing in a completely dark room without light).  In this case, hallucinogens can replicate the signal and trick the brain into seeing whatever people see on hallucinogens (colors, shapes, etc).  
Example 2: The person is blind due to a defect in the visual cortex of the brain.  Their eyes may work just fine, but their brain is incapable of processing visual data.  These people literally see nothing (not black, nothing).  This is a hard concept to grasp for those who have had some degree of visual input all their lives.  Even total blackness is &quot;something&quot; but these people see &quot;nothing&quot;.  The best way to demonstrate this to a person is to think of it like this:  take one hand, put it behind your back and open it.  What visual signal are you getting from your hand?  What is your hand &quot;seeing&quot; behind you?  You get no visual input from your hand, so you see nothing behind you - not even blackness.  That is the closest I can demonstrate seeing &quot;nothing&quot;.  These people under hallucinogens will hallucinate other stimuli the brain has wired to act in lieu of visual processes (auditory, tactile, even smell).  


Rob3112     Sun Feb 4 07:46:43 2018 UTC

Closing your eyes while on hallucinogens you can &quot;see&quot; fractals and geometric shapes and colours. I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s what they see. 


000010TEN     Sun Feb 4 08:05:20 2018 UTC

how do you know what colours are if you&#39;ve never seen them? with shapes at least you can feel the structure.


Stay_Frosty5     Sun Feb 4 16:59:04 2018 UTC

you don‚Äôt have to know what something is to see it. 


NekoInkling     Sun Feb 4 13:12:50 2018 UTC

Don&#39;t they just have the inability to see, instead of constantly closed eyes?


lackdude22     Sun Feb 4 07:32:50 2018 UTC

Hit up the tommy edison experince on youtube. Answers this very question

tomfoli     Sun Feb 4 10:30:49 2018 UTC

Interesting.


SightlessSenshi     Sun Feb 4 16:20:25 2018 UTC

Being blind myself, I&#39;ve always been curious about this. I think it depends on how much exposure to sight we have or have not had. If there was some exposure, we&#39;d likely see anything our brain remembered or could generate from extant memories.


Noughiphiet     Sun Feb 4 17:12:52 2018 UTC

I would be very curious to see a study of the blind and DMT.


Montregloe     Sun Feb 4 10:58:04 2018 UTC

Depends on their memories and their blindness


mrs-pootin     Sun Feb 4 17:03:28 2018 UTC

We can‚Äôt know. They can communicate with us


squishymarshmellow     Sun Feb 4 17:46:08 2018 UTC

They can feel colors


6justice6     Sun Feb 4 21:19:16 2018 UTC

Auditory and tactile hallucinations. 


TheBelovedAbsentee     Sun Feb 4 10:01:52 2018 UTC

They don&#39;t see, they don&#39;t have the sense of sight


DrMadlove     Sun Feb 4 07:24:34 2018 UTC

Same shit I suppose? But I hope we find out!


dev0urer     Sun Feb 4 07:37:53 2018 UTC

Possibly the same shit if they lost their sight, but if they&#39;re blind since birth...

poeticrubbish     Sun Feb 4 17:31:57 2018 UTC

Man there was <em>just</em> an AMA about this. If I recall correctly, if someone is not completely blind (can see pockets of light), they will have visual hallucincations. But otherwise if they&#39;re completely blind, it&#39;s all auditory hallucinations.

Ghost_Killer_     Sun Feb 4 21:21:27 2018 UTC

I would assume that since halloucinogens efdect the brain, not so much the eyes, they would &quot;see&quot; the same thing everyone else does. If you really want to know, find a blind person and put mushrooms on their burger and ask what they see


Thekittycats     Sun Feb 4 22:12:02 2018 UTC

They gain their eyesight

Have hallucinogens and close your eyes you&#39;ll know.
