Holy shit I never realized how much I needed to know the answer to this question till now.

I dunno, maybe they get auditory hallucinations? I hope someone answers. 

Closing your eyes while on hallucinogens you can &quot;see&quot; fractals and geometric shapes and colours. I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s what they see. 

how do you know what colours are if you&#39;ve never seen them? with shapes at least you can feel the structure.

Don&#39;t they just have the inability to see, instead of constantly closed eyes?

Some crazy ass braille. 
No really, different blind people have different problems so it would depend on the situation. If the rods and cones dont work at all, then nothing is &quot;seen&quot;. Then you get all metaphysical with the inagination stuff. I think it would be similar to a trip in that the mind wonders and the visual parts are present, but pethaps the visual parts are the brains response to light as well, in which case there would be nothing. I DONT KNOW!

Hit up the tommy edison experince on youtube. Answers this very question 

Blind people, like sighted people, report auditory, olfactory, gustatory and tactile hallucinations, but they do so at a higher rate. I&#39;ve just found a remarkable 1963 study from the Archives of Opthalmology in which 24 blind participants took LSD to see if they could experience visual hallucinations.

This is as close as I can get you.

Interesting.

They don&#39;t see, they don&#39;t have the sense of sight

Commenting for answer

Depends on their memories and their blindness

Saving till someone answers

Same shit I suppose? But I hope we find out!

Possibly the same shit if they lost their sight, but if they&#39;re blind since birth...
