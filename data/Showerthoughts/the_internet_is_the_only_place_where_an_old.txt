I worry about some of my older relatives online.  I put ublock origin on many of their computers as they get fooled by some of the more convincing virus scan ads or malicious ads that can be difficult to close.  They also seem to follow click bait links to sketchy sites.
On the other hand I&#39;ve got one who plans every trip and vacation online through Google apps, uses online banking and PayPal, loves seeing recorded concerts on Youtube of his favorite oldies bands, and is just having a great time with it.

My grandmother loves the internet and technology, and is more modernised and has better gadgets than I do. 


AStrangeBrew     Sun Feb 4 19:11:04 2018 UTC

My grandpa has Amazon Alexa and uses it all the time, he basically just talks to it. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s similar to the Alexa for Old People skit on SNL


emp919     Mon Feb 5 00:12:10 2018 UTC

That&#39;s probably my 3rd favorite SNL skit of all time behind &quot;Child Molester Robot&quot; with The Rock at number 2, and &quot;Meet your Second Wife&quot; with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at number 1


Shippoyasha     Sun Feb 4 23:05:46 2018 UTC

A lot of old people have a ton of money they get from social security, their investments and savings accounts. It always shocks me what some old people buy, because of their extremely high cost.


The_Nightman_82     Sun Feb 4 21:31:08 2018 UTC

Meanwhile, someone’s grandma is trolling someone over on 4chan 


Unique_account_     Sun Feb 4 21:12:29 2018 UTC

Did you hear the news of eBay and PayPal?


wolfyankees33     Sun Feb 4 22:23:13 2018 UTC

What news

I didn&#39;t, but I just looked it up.  It looks like good news to me.  I sell online, but haven&#39;t used the PayPal/eBay combo for years and just use it for personal payments mostly.  The past few years it has been a pretty big mess that favored scammers giving them two options to dispute.  Lower fees and a streamlined payment/checkout system could bring back both buyers and sellers that have abandoned it.  On Black Friday I purchased a TV on eBay and it was a pain to not be able to see payment info in the same app and have to go to PayPal.  I think eBay made the right choice.

My in-laws fell for ransom ware scams twice.  Same scam.  Months apart.  Two....fucking...times.


eastmemphisguy     Sun Feb 4 20:54:02 2018 UTC

Both my (long since divorced) parents fell for the exact same online scam just months apart. I convinced mom to do a credit card charge back, so she ended up not losing anything, but my dad refused to even try. I couldn&#39;t even get him to admit that he was scammed. So infuriating!


Camero32     Sun Feb 4 19:44:32 2018 UTC

We live in 2018 meanwhile these guys are living in a very dull place


dfghkjsksgjkghskghs     Sun Feb 4 16:44:11 2018 UTC

I know this old man who died jacking off on a website called Chaturbate. I don&#39;t think a kid could do that


IDontCareAtThisPoint     Sun Feb 4 19:07:42 2018 UTC

Wait, you know him or you know of him? I remember seeing that a few years ago. His wife found him and called 911 while it was still recording. 


dfghkjsksgjkghskghs     Sun Feb 4 19:41:02 2018 UTC

I know of him. I think his name is Bill. I was on 4chan /b/ some time ago and they were talking about busting a nut for Bill. Was stupid.


Balthazar3000     Sun Feb 4 20:24:33 2018 UTC

Sounds more wholesome than stupid.


Sonic13128     Sun Feb 4 21:43:05 2018 UTC

Welcome back. 


ELaskanator     Sun Feb 4 18:47:32 2018 UTC

Predators of old people are scum of the earth. Rather, all scammers are but they like to focus on the elderly.


Gig472     Sun Feb 4 22:30:32 2018 UTC

I mean if your going to scam people you might as well do it correctly and focus on susceptible people.


rikkicandance     Sun Feb 4 22:58:32 2018 UTC

Yeah that’s definitely in the beginners guide to scamming. 


plaze6288     Sun Feb 4 18:58:32 2018 UTC

My grandma posts the most savage stuff. No filter at all


LurkeringIrish     Sun Feb 4 18:33:21 2018 UTC

If you read some of the comments on Facebook left by ‘older people’ on news publications you’d realize you’re very wrong.


ElijahDK     Sun Feb 4 21:21:14 2018 UTC

I think the post is more in the sense of not understanding it fully.


Tcowstuff     Sun Feb 4 15:25:30 2018 UTC

Hah I don’t think so. A vast majority of those insane/toxic/racist Facebook comments are from middle aged people and old people. 


Babi_Gurrl     Sun Feb 4 16:01:18 2018 UTC

So, most people? 


Faladorable     Sun Feb 4 18:58:33 2018 UTC

no just middle aged, old people, college students and the occasional girl scout 


BeaumontG     Sun Feb 4 19:40:56 2018 UTC

I bet you don&#39;t have children, or smaller relatives. Kids are pretty much savage tribe people lol


BeaumontG     Sun Feb 4 20:02:57 2018 UTC

Sure mate! Just kidding on the fact that children are tiny monsters


yubimarcano     Sun Feb 4 21:09:33 2018 UTC

My mom just asked me how is it possible that people know she has read a text if they are not seeing her reading it


Halta001     Sun Feb 4 10:23:56 2018 UTC

and the internet is the place where the child start swearing and flaming everyone (in games)

You have no idea about the kind of image boards i grew up with


mhol7597     Sun Feb 4 17:47:52 2018 UTC

Old people are far more naive.


ZoeZebra     Sun Feb 4 21:20:58 2018 UTC

We get more naive as we age?


mhol7597     Sun Feb 4 21:22:50 2018 UTC

We get less &quot;of the time&quot; but I imagine this is very predictable.


bannable03     Sun Feb 4 21:01:00 2018 UTC

I think you have not spent time around children in a setting where they feel comfortable being honest.
Cause... LMFAO!
5 year olds casually talk about oral sex and &quot;skull fucking you to death&quot;, I&#39;ve never heard an elderly speak in a way that pbs wouldn&#39;t broadcast.


mmbossman     Sun Feb 4 21:26:14 2018 UTC

Dude, that&#39;s not a 5 year old. That&#39;s a midget BDSM phone sex operator.


regoparker     Sun Feb 4 20:43:51 2018 UTC

And public schools.


burningallthewitches     Sun Feb 4 21:08:24 2018 UTC

Except when they&#39;re being racist 


mmbossman     Sun Feb 4 21:22:06 2018 UTC

&quot;Lemon party? That sounds like exactly what I need to perfect my lemon meringue pie!&quot;- Grandma, probably

Spoken like a child.


sl1878     Sun Feb 4 21:30:53 2018 UTC

Considering how many grandpas watch Fox News and Sean Hannity, I doubt it.


laughing_cat     Sun Feb 4 21:36:02 2018 UTC

There are lots of internet savvy older people - I think what you have here is a combination of a couple of things:1) By definition 50% of the population is below average intelligence 2) Lots of people are too lazy to learn much of anything new after the age of 40 or so


MaxMontana     Sun Feb 4 22:26:59 2018 UTC

I know you’ll get a kick outa this if you read it OP. 
I had the luxury of explaining porn to my grandfather a couple years ago. He was familiar already with the topic, but because of his age there was obvious knowledge gap. 
This fool legit went on a bunk site and opted to download whatever shit they were hustling. He gets a virus and on startup on his laptop he gets prompted with an option to pay cash for a “get out of jail free card.”


CommunistFesto     Sun Feb 4 23:14:10 2018 UTC

Um....have you ever been on Omegle?


SpeedyPrius     Sun Feb 4 23:21:15 2018 UTC

I’m 61 and have been around since the internet was born.  I remember when Windows was new, I was hard core and thought if you couldn’t deal with some DOS commands you didn’t need to be on a computer.  The only nationally known internet service was AOL and they sent a new CD every other week.
It has been a fascinating trip and I love it.  To me, the ability to look up anything at anytime is priceless.  The closest thing we had to that when I grew up was a set of encyclopedias!
Some of us are still learning...


Cpt_more_Gain     Sun Feb 4 19:39:55 2018 UTC

I dont get why older people cant use technologie very Well. I mean they actually saw the progress with PCs ans the Internet. They could have learned it all


JamesR624     Sun Feb 4 18:44:58 2018 UTC

Uhh.... have you <em>never</em> been on Facebook?


GeneralL33     Sun Feb 4 18:50:36 2018 UTC
