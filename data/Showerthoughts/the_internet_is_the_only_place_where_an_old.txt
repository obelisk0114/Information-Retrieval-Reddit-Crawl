I worry about some of my older relatives online.  I put ublock origin on many of their computers as they get fooled by some of the more convincing virus scan ads or malicious ads that can be difficult to close.  They also seem to follow click bait links to sketchy sites.
On the other hand I&#39;ve got one who plans every trip and vacation online through Google apps, uses online banking and PayPal, loves seeing recorded concerts on Youtube of his favorite oldies bands, and is just having a great time with it.  

That&#39;s called grooming 

and the internet is the place where the child start swearing and flaming everyone (in games)
