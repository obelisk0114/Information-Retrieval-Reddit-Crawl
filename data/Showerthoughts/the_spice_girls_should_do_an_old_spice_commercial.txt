If you wanna be my lover, you better not smell like shit

Who do you think you are?

if i could give you more than one upboat sir or madame, i would

Looks like you got downboated.

I still wait for Eminem advertising M&amp;M&#39;s... It just has to happen someday.

Which spice girl would Eminem impregnate tho?
Hehe

Is that what you want? Is that what you really really want?

I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha)I wanna really, really, really wanna [enter old spice dude] - be on a horse

That would be an epic commercial.

This is tangential, but I&#39;ve often wondered. If the Spice Girls were formed today instead of 1994, do you think <em>Scary Spice</em> would have instead been <em>Pumpkin Spice?</em>

Pepper Spice would make more sense. :P

Yes, I&#39;m sure naming the one black girl after a literal black spice would go over well :)

It would go better than naming the only black spice &quot;scary.&quot; 

That was reflective of her personality, not her skin color.

So then why was the only redhead named ginger? 

Are you really asking me to explain why commentary on hair color is more socially acceptable than commentary on race?

Can you not tell when someone is being facetious? 

On the internet? With text? With zero indication of sarcasm, such as an emoji or a &quot;/s?&quot;
No.

Good point. 

She was originally named Sexy but that was deemed inappropriate for a group with a sizable following of children. 

Huh, never knew that. 

And the blonde was “baby”

Now that they&#39;re old.

They would still be old spice GIRLS duuuh!

This guy gets it.

I once saw an Alice Cooper concert back when the Spice Girls were at their peak. Near the end of the show, when he was introducing the band, he would say &quot;Bass Spice, Chuck Garrick!&quot;, and so on, with each band member. After introducing the entire band, he then said, &quot;and ME!&quot;, then undid the jacket he was wearing to reveal a t-shirt that read, OLD SPICE.

But old spice is smelling water and spice girl is people. Silly.

Would Terry Crews play the 6th member named Old Spice?

Mel better be that one bitch in the background eating a burrito while riding a unicorn in a red jumpsuit in the middle of traffic advertising Old Spice. 

Would it be something like <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4f9vqrpHRk8" rel="nofollow">this impulse commercial</a>  ?

Or KFC. Frick, KFC follows them

Old Spice guy should start a band

Oh good, two things I hate in the same place at the same time. Should make them both easier to avoid.

Only if Salt-n-Pepa make a cameo. 

No, just no.
