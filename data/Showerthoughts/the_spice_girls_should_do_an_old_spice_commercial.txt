If you wanna be my lover, you better not smell like shit


maxiedaniels     Sun Feb 4 16:52:12 2018 UTC

If they did this, it would absolutely go viral.


captain_insane_O     Sun Feb 4 04:58:19 2018 UTC

if i could give you more than one upboat sir or madame, i would


MinerBoy004     Sun Feb 4 09:41:37 2018 UTC

Looks like you got downboated.


suas1234     Sat Feb 3 21:55:46 2018 UTC

I still wait for Eminem advertising M&amp;M&#39;s... It just has to happen someday.


Mat_Quantum     Sun Feb 4 16:57:35 2018 UTC

Idk why this hasn’t happened yet


WatchJojoDotCom     Sun Feb 4 10:01:10 2018 UTC

Which spice girl would Eminem impregnate tho?
Hehe


Pork_Chap     Sat Feb 3 19:14:29 2018 UTC

Is that what you want? Is that what you really really want?


IM_Steve_323     Sat Feb 3 23:08:28 2018 UTC

I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha)I wanna really, really, really wanna [enter old spice dude] - be on a horse


brzztffn     Sat Feb 3 23:27:28 2018 UTC

That would be an epic commercial.


emtwo1950     Sat Feb 3 22:25:09 2018 UTC

This is tangential, but I&#39;ve often wondered. If the Spice Girls were formed today instead of 1994, do you think <em>Scary Spice</em> would have instead been <em>Pumpkin Spice?</em>


SkeweredFromEarToEye     Sun Feb 4 02:37:07 2018 UTC

Pepper Spice would make more sense. :P


emtwo1950     Sun Feb 4 02:47:39 2018 UTC

Yes, I&#39;m sure naming the one black girl after a literal black spice would go over well :)


nenapod1     Sun Feb 4 02:56:19 2018 UTC

It would go better than naming the only black spice &quot;scary.&quot; 


emtwo1950     Sun Feb 4 02:57:42 2018 UTC

That was reflective of her personality, not her skin color.


nenapod1     Sun Feb 4 02:58:18 2018 UTC

So then why was the only redhead named ginger? 


emtwo1950     Sun Feb 4 03:09:05 2018 UTC

Are you really asking me to explain why commentary on hair color is more socially acceptable than commentary on race?


nenapod1     Sun Feb 4 03:11:13 2018 UTC

Can you not tell when someone is being facetious? 


emtwo1950     Sun Feb 4 03:12:34 2018 UTC

On the internet? With text? With zero indication of sarcasm, such as an emoji or a &quot;/s?&quot;
No.


nenapod1     Sun Feb 4 03:13:05 2018 UTC

Good point. 


Eroe777     Sun Feb 4 04:51:07 2018 UTC

She was originally named Sexy but that was deemed inappropriate for a group with a sizable following of children. 


nenapod1     Sun Feb 4 04:51:52 2018 UTC

Huh, never knew that. 


Jovet_Hunter     Sun Feb 4 07:42:55 2018 UTC

And the blonde was “baby”


BigTallCanUke     Sun Feb 4 05:59:37 2018 UTC

I once saw an Alice Cooper concert back when the Spice Girls were at their peak. Near the end of the show, when he was introducing the band, he would say &quot;Bass Spice, Chuck Garrick!&quot;, and so on, with each band member. After introducing the entire band, he then said, &quot;and ME!&quot;, then undid the jacket he was wearing to reveal a t-shirt that read, OLD SPICE.


Molbiodude     Sat Feb 3 23:45:55 2018 UTC

Now that they&#39;re old.


besticandois10bucks     Sun Feb 4 00:57:56 2018 UTC

They would still be old spice GIRLS duuuh!


Kstewbbs     Sat Feb 3 23:50:59 2018 UTC

This guy gets it.


iambeautifulman     Sat Feb 3 18:58:03 2018 UTC

But old spice is smelling water and spice girl is people. Silly.


LadyBearJenna     Sun Feb 4 01:25:44 2018 UTC

Would Terry Crews play the 6th member named Old Spice? 


HungryLikeTheWolf99     Sat Feb 3 19:58:21 2018 UTC

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/yEk8UqX.jpg" rel="nofollow">I&#39;d give it a couple years...</a> But definitely soon.


TheChristianServer27     Sun Feb 4 06:54:55 2018 UTC

Mel better be that one bitch in the background eating a burrito while riding a unicorn in a red jumpsuit in the middle of traffic advertising Old Spice. 


pinkietoe     Sat Feb 3 20:23:59 2018 UTC

Would it be something like <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4f9vqrpHRk8" rel="nofollow">this impulse commercial</a>  ?


Temmie65     Sat Feb 3 23:18:20 2018 UTC

Or KFC. Frick, KFC follows them


Johnnyschuler     Sun Feb 4 05:24:36 2018 UTC

Old Spice guy should start a band


BrokenEye3     Sun Feb 4 06:16:19 2018 UTC

Oh good, two things I hate in the same place at the same time. Should make them both easier to avoid.


A_Washer-Dryer     Sun Feb 4 07:22:21 2018 UTC

Only if Salt-n-Pepa make a cameo. 


LodgePoleMurphy     Sun Feb 4 08:00:32 2018 UTC

No, just no.


ReddyRedditer     Sun Feb 4 23:35:25 2018 UTC

and each spice girl would be a different scent
