Example: So if you have 3 people, instead of slicing the typical 8 pieces, they would slice 9. Then, there isn&#39;t that awkward situation of one person only getting 2 slices.

What if I told you that you can ask them to slice your pizza into your desired number of slices

Does that work at every single cheap place me and my poor college friends would go to?
Hot-N-Readys come presliced IIRC

Someone just got only 2 slices.

Why on earth would you get a measly 8/9 slice pizza for 3 people? You need atleast a party size...

If that party size ain&#39;t 3N, where N is a natural number, then imma be upset with you.
