I totally feel for those babies. My dad&#39;s birthday is about a week before Christmas and my birthday is in late September. So I&#39;m either a birthday or Christmas baby.

Lots of end of Sept babies from new years too.

Huh. And here I thought it was the result of sexual intercourse with no rhythm.

You can also say that people with birthdays nine months after one of their parents’ is the result of birthday sex

An equally harrowing revelation

If you assume no sex at any other time in the month


amaezingjew     Sun Feb 4 22:25:36 2018 UTC

Not only.

Is there any evidence that more babies are born 9 months after specific dates?

No
