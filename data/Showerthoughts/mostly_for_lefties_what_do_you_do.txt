What do you do with your right hand (or for those of you who aren&#39;t in their right mind) out of habit now, that you had to for a lack of proper equipment, etc?

I’m practically ambidextrous, given that most simple habits I do can be done with both of my hands. I open doors, open cans, hold mugs, play violin, and even accidentally write with my right hand. Of course, my left is always more precise and stronger, but I have adapted. <em>Improvise. Adapt. Overcome!</em>

The only thing I can’t do with my right hand is write. Sometimes cutting food is a struggle.

I’ve always cut with scissors using my right and such, but one thing I hate about being a lefty is that when writing I always smear the graphite or ink.

When I color (yes it&#39;s so calming) I constantly smear it.I literally fan the pages to make sure it&#39;s dry.

I have had to use scissors way too often because I didn&#39;t want to pay $15-25 for left handed ones.
