Because the friend zone is just an excuse to spare your feelings , rather than saying: I’m not attracted to you.

Me and a close friend that have known each other since high school, I’m tempted to ask her out

Good friend of mine just got through a divorce and is (kind of) pursuing a friend he’s had since high school. Haven’t seen him happier in a while
