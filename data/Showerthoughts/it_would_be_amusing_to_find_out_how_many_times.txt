I just imagine a meeting with death after you die and he&#39;s prepared a slideshow of all the times he almost got you.

&quot;Hey, so I&#39;m Death... I know you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I actually have something crazy to show you!&quot;

Only if he gives football commentary about the events. 

It needs to be Norm Mcdonald. Either way I hope it doesn&#39;t just go black.
The one thing we know is we came from the same void we return to once. It&#39;s not unthinkable for it to happen again

Actually that would be pretty interesting 

So, our rivalry comes to an end...

I&#39;m much more interested in knowing the number of women who wanted to fuck me but whom I was oblivious to
assuming it&#39;s not zero

Probably zero for me.

My number is at least 3. People were coming out of the woodwork &quot;disappointed&quot; when I got engaged..... Why TF didn&#39;t you make a move then? Or airway show some interest, god damn

I bet your Mother in law was the most disappointed.

I’m guessing 99% would be while you were driving.

Madness is knowing every time you were close to death and sex.

I imagine that time I met Xenia Onatopp was a fairly close call. 

I&#39;ve always hoped for just a stat sheet of which you could search for anything you want to know.  e.g. How many bugs did I inadvertently step on?  Or gallons of water drank.  You know, useless stuff.

I DO know how many times I avoided Death in VietNam, so I guess i am &#39;ahead of the curve&#39; here, for a change! Or as Kipling wrote--&quot;I have walked with Death and named him friend&quot;

Same, but as a young ignorant traveler living there six months

I would like to know, who all was in love with me(but not regret it) and what famous people I met but didn’t know it ( they often look like random strangers outside of Hollywood) but I did spot Robert Plant once. He looked very Hollywood and out of place in our small town.

One of my favourite authors wrote a book about this recently. She figured out she’s almost died 17 times. 

What counts in that though?   If you believe in the butterfly effect then every instant of every second is a time where you avoid death. 

That would be dank
