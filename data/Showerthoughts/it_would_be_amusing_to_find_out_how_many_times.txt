I just imagine a meeting with death after you die and he&#39;s prepared a slideshow of all the times he almost got you.

&quot;Hey, so I&#39;m Death... I know you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I actually have something crazy to show you!&quot;


ReaLyreJ     Sun Feb 4 06:46:17 2018 UTC

Only if he gives football commentary about the events. 


TheRedmanCometh     Sun Feb 4 08:19:04 2018 UTC

It needs to be Norm Mcdonald. Either way I hope it doesn&#39;t just go black.
The one thing we know is we came from the same void we return to once. It&#39;s not unthinkable for it to happen again


Bowfire5     Sun Feb 4 00:11:35 2018 UTC

Actually that would be pretty interesting 


EthanRDoesMC     Sun Feb 4 05:38:25 2018 UTC

So, our rivalry comes to an end...


rebelde_sin_causa     Sun Feb 4 02:12:25 2018 UTC

I&#39;m much more interested in knowing the number of women who wanted to fuck me but whom I was oblivious to
assuming it&#39;s not zero


CanBurgersSwim     Sun Feb 4 03:25:52 2018 UTC

Probably zero for me.


Clearesammich     Sun Feb 4 04:57:18 2018 UTC

My number is at least 3. People were coming out of the woodwork &quot;disappointed&quot; when I got engaged..... Why TF didn&#39;t you make a move then? Or airway show some interest, god damn


SexlexiaSufferer     Sun Feb 4 08:09:53 2018 UTC

I bet your Mother in law was the most disappointed.


hopelesscompensation     Sun Feb 4 05:50:06 2018 UTC

I’m guessing 99% would be while you were driving.


JodieFostersFist     Sun Feb 4 06:52:03 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve always hoped for just a stat sheet of which you could search for anything you want to know.  e.g. How many bugs did I inadvertently step on?  Or gallons of water drank.  You know, useless stuff.


GTPhotoNJ     Sun Feb 4 14:25:51 2018 UTC

This is all I’ve ever wanted.  I’m so happy someone else think this way. 
Which words you used the most.  How many years you spent sleeping.  Cumulative length of your fingernails if you hadn’t cut them. 


saq1610     Sun Feb 4 18:38:28 2018 UTC

Which words you used the most
Id wager for most people (myself included) that&#39;d be: &quot;Fuck&quot;


ChiGuy133     Sun Feb 4 19:31:34 2018 UTC

that&#39;s why this year i&#39;ve started tracking things a lot more. not really ever going to be valuable, but that&#39;s the shit i think is cool to know. This year i&#39;ve drank roughly 27.25 gallons of water so far. I&#39;ve slept for well over a week. I&#39;ve spent almost 2 days in commute. A lot of the things you mention or hint to are impossible (bugs, what i&#39;ve said...) but it&#39;s fun to track the things i am capable of tracking


bobrossthemobboss     Sun Feb 4 03:27:46 2018 UTC

Madness is knowing every time you were close to death and sex.


iAesc     Sun Feb 4 12:57:24 2018 UTC

I imagine that time I met Xenia Onatopp was a fairly close call. 


Miss-Auli     Sun Feb 4 08:06:07 2018 UTC

One of my favourite authors wrote a book about this recently. She figured out she’s almost died 17 times. 


KiltedTailorofMaine     Sun Feb 4 02:31:11 2018 UTC

I DO know how many times I avoided Death in VietNam, so I guess i am &#39;ahead of the curve&#39; here, for a change! Or as Kipling wrote--&quot;I have walked with Death and named him friend&quot;


hymerej     Sun Feb 4 04:52:02 2018 UTC

Same, but as a young ignorant traveler living there six months


KiltedTailorofMaine     Sun Feb 4 23:47:03 2018 UTC

Ditto description of traveler// there for 18 months and enjoyed it!


questionguess     Sun Feb 4 07:15:44 2018 UTC

I would like to know, who all was in love with me(but not regret it) and what famous people I met but didn’t know it ( they often look like random strangers outside of Hollywood) but I did spot Robert Plant once. He looked very Hollywood and out of place in our small town.


golgol12     Sun Feb 4 09:20:46 2018 UTC

What counts in that though?   If you believe in the butterfly effect then every instant of every second is a time where you avoid death. 


Primallama     Sun Feb 4 12:27:32 2018 UTC

That would be dank 


foetyeight     Sun Feb 4 16:27:47 2018 UTC

You just did it every second in your life.. 


SergioGMika     Sun Feb 4 03:06:32 2018 UTC

He said that in the post...
