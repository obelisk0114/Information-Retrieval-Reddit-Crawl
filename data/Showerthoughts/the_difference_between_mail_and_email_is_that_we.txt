How can you shop from amazon and not mail yourself something? Itâ€™s not like those amazon boxes showed up unexpected.

I once did it by accident on my first time mailing something.<br/>I was mailing a postcard to receive free magazines/books from Kids WB back in the late 90&#39;s to early 00&#39;s. They would send promotional magazines with their Saturday morning cartoons in them that usually included stickers and stuff. All you had to do was send in a postcard with your address. I accidentally flip-flopped the sender and recipient addresses.

You did if you had two houses.

I see no reason for 2nd house

You do if you don&#39;t want someone to find something.

People used to attempt poor man&#39;s patents by sealing an idea up in a letter and mailing it to themselves. Important note, the US is now first-to-file for patents IIRC, so this is useless nowadays.

IIRC stamps collectors sometimes does it

Eh...it was a poor man&#39;s patent thing, and even then.....it was never really a viable way to actually legally protect whatever was mailed. Usually media(demo tapes, mix tapes? Etc.) were most common.

And a commonality is that you still get junk mail in both. And nobody reads it in either medium.
