So we need shoelaces made out of headphone cords, and headphones with shoelaces on em.

Then comes out a Shoe with headphones and the funny videos where people use shoes as phone becomes reality

Space X wants to know your location?

There is a different theory.  Scientists say headphones tangle because of the pocket.  Try putting your shoes in your pocket and walk around to test it yourself.

I actually tested this and i can confirm that they don&#39;t tangle


MasterOfDerps     Sun Feb 4 12:16:37 2018 UTC

That&#39;s probably because you don&#39;t listen to music with those shoes.

Well shoelaces get untied because every step we take applies about 5Gs to the laces. I can&#39;t explain headphones getting tangled though that&#39;s some other shit

Not really. It&#39;s a well proven movement from ordered to disordered systems, we call it Entropy.


CivilizedBeast     Sun Feb 4 08:41:35 2018 UTC

Crazy = Entropy, got it.

If you know about the Heat Death Theory, it is crazy.
