You&#39;ve never actually seen the world.  Only reflections of light.


ThaShark     Sun Feb 4 21:14:54 2018 UTC

What is seeing? <em>Situation intensifies</em>

Today we&#39;re going to talk about the 5 senses.


stegotops7     Sun Feb 4 23:19:27 2018 UTC

But do we really have 5 senses? Or do we have more?


CommunistFesto     Sun Feb 4 23:21:49 2018 UTC

milochuisael     Sun Feb 4 20:52:13 2018 UTC

I can see my lips too


tkaish     Sun Feb 4 21:00:23 2018 UTC

And your tongue if you stick it out.


CommunistFesto     Sun Feb 4 23:18:25 2018 UTC

And the bridge of your nose.


Fuzilumpkinz     Sun Feb 4 20:49:21 2018 UTC

At least I never have to see true failure. Just pictures or reflections.


CommunistFesto     Sun Feb 4 23:19:13 2018 UTC

So my dick isn&#39;t big?

I&#39;m a dickhead and I see my dick everyday, so your statement is invalid.

You&#39;ve Never Actually Seen Your Own Face, Only Pictures Or Reflections.


absolutemonsterxx     Mon Feb 5 01:02:10 2018 UTC

I can see my nose and my nose is part of my face


ThaShark     Sun Feb 4 21:16:45 2018 UTC

Yeah &#39;cause when I look into the mirror or see myself in a picture, I&#39;m actually looking at someone else. <strong>Makes sense</strong>
