windows 8.1 and 10 come with windows defender, that&#39;s all i used for 3 years, and never got a virus.

Legit porn sites are usually clean since they wouldn&#39;t get any traffic if they infected people&#39;s computers. Going to that random link from Facebook and looking at that site that doesn&#39;t control their ads... Now that&#39;s like raw doggin.

If you watch porn the right way you wont need an antivirus
