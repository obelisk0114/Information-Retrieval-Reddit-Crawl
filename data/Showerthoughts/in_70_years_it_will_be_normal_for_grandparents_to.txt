Iâ€™m sure they said the same thing 70 years ago.

That&#39;s actually kind of fascinating

I agree. It highlights how extreme the disconnect really is from one generation to the next.

You&#39;ll know how computers and smartphones work.
You&#39;ll have no idea how the neural transcommunicator 3000 works, nor how to operate it

3000?? Yeah 2030 called, it wants it&#39;s technology back.
