There was a truck commercial where dude said, &quot;I&#39;m an actor, but I&#39;m not acting.&quot;  Then he went on about how much he loved his truck.  

Was he convincing? And if so, does that mean he is a good actor or that he was not acting?

Didn&#39;t convince me.  Wish I could find it.  Was a Mexican actor in a full sized, fully loaded truck.  In general all those commercials pulled people off the streets.  Some just happened to be actors lol.  Regardless of background they were told they get around $200.  Most seemed to know the more excited they acted the better their chances of getting in the commercial/get a little more money.  Cheap, and easy.  

I think it was a Chevy commercial. 

In general all those commercials pulled people off the streets. Some just happened to be actors lol.
Bullshit, they&#39;re all hired through acting agencies. Most of them have full time jobs in something other than acting, therefore they&#39;re not &quot;technically&quot; actors. 

Now there&#39;s an idea. &quot;The people in this commercial are actors, but they&#39;re not very good ones.&quot;

&quot;These are real people, not your drug-addled hallucination&quot;
&quot;The are real people, not trained animals wearing the skins of their victims&quot;
&quot;These would be real people, except that everyone is robots but you&quot;

&quot;These are real people, not velociraptors in clever human disguises. Fool me once, shame on you...&quot;

Woah, breaking the fourth wall. Avant garde!

People do crazy things for money

The following are actors acting:
&quot;I&#39;m not an actor, and I&#39;m not acting!...&quot;

All the world’s a stage, yknow?

And we are merely players!

In act one, I was struggling to survive. Nobody wanted my action dead or aliveIn act two, I hit the big time and bodies be all up on my behindAnd I can&#39;t help myself cuz I was born to shineIf you don&#39;t like it, you can shove it. But you don&#39;t like it, you love itSo I&#39;ll be up here in a rage until they put the curtain down on the stage&quot;

Username checks out! (But not the reference I was going for, lol)

Haha what reference were you going for

Shakespeare.

Performers and portrayer

Each another&#39;s audience outside the gilded cage! 

Performers and portrayers,

And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.

Living in the limelight?

Damn it Paper Mario!

Shakespeare!! :)

They are hired to appear in the commercial.  They are paid to be there.  They are given direction.  Even if they aren’t all serious professional actors in the traditional sense, they are credited as actors in the commercial.
So, are actors.  Just maybe not Actors.

I act, therefore I am an actor 

Yeah I bet if it was taken to court the TV network would define actors as being members of some sort of Actors union

Maybe they just mean that they aren’t paying them. 

Do you honestly believe Keanu Reeves is human like the rest of us?

Keanu is the real life tragic superhero (like Spiderman) considering he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident and he has been in a &#39;be nice to everyone and treasure everything&#39; mode ever since. 

He&#39;s already over 300yrs old, how could he be human?

Yes. 

No. He is God.

I always wondered why that would matter. Like who says “this random schmuck thinks it’s a good deal, so it must be!”

Tons of people 

They aren&#39;t real people though

Probably because someone won a deceptive advertising lawsuit and now others are just being careful.  

Actor lives matter

Oh yeah? Have you ever eaten with one?

An actor or a real person?

Quote from The Producers

Oh. Sorry, I&#39;m unfamiliar with it. My bad.

What about Calculon? 

And real people are god damn liars. 

Well, the idea is that an actor isn&#39;t playing him/herself in a commercial, but rather a character. It&#39;s a role or a part, and it&#39;s not &quot;real.&quot;

I f-ing hate Chevy simply because of their commercials. I especially hate the one where they loaded some people&#39;s families into an SUV. The purpose of the commercial is to associate good feelings about Chevy when the commercial wasn&#39;t about the SUV at all.

Have you been ignoring every commercial you’ve ever seen? All advertisements essentially try to associate happiness with the product (or promote an action through sadness)
If a product can stand on its own merit without that type of advertising, then it doesn’t need to be advertised - word of mouth alone will make the product popular. Eg Tesla. 

Nemotoads are people too

You say that now, but wait until they drink your house.

This aways confused me about porn as a kid. “Real Girls!!!” Like what else would they be?

&quot;We&#39;re actors-- we are the opposite of people!&quot; --Tom Stoppard, <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em>

Came here hoping to find this. Well done, friend.

That’s what I always say too!

i thought the running theory were they were all lizard aliens or some shit

Are they though?  Are they.... 

Hollywood:  Shit, they’re onto us

Or so the actors would like you to believe!

Or......
Or they&#39;re not....
<sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>Illuminati</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>

&quot;Shit! He/she/they have caught onto us! Dammmmit.&quot;

Everyone is an actor except you.

How bad would it suck to spend your life trying to be an actor and you finally get a job in a commercial and they label you &quot;not an actor&quot;??

&quot;Real actors, not people.&quot;

They are also actors. 

Ever watched 30 Rock?

Are they?

I&#39;ve literally never seen that quote 

May be off topic but is there any backlash for the company if they tell us &quot;these are not paid actors&quot; and they are? Like someone looked through headshots and called an agent to get this person in here to shoot the commercial? im oblivious to the casting process so this may be how they find their &quot;real people&quot; too...but Could someone hypothetically sue them for false advertisement? 

Actors have to be in the actors union. These real people are want to be actors on their first commercial / acting job. After this they are no longer real people.

For some actors that&#39;s debatable 

Mr clean man is not

Az

But they don&#39;t act like real people...

Or <em>are</em> they?

Wait what? I didn’t know this...I thought actors lived in our TVs

They do. And the characters they play live in our hearts. 

There are guidelines used by the Screen Actors Guild that determine what a &quot;real person&quot; is and what they are allowed to say. It pretty much secures jobs for professional actors. A good example are those old Gieco commercials starring a customer and a famous person (i.e. Little Richard).

I said this in class when we were learning about propaganda. She was upset to say the least.

And real people are cheaper to hire than actors

#ActorLivesMatter

My husband just said the same thing yesterday.

False Realism

Don&#39;t be fooled actors aren&#39;t real people.

Not in Hollywood they’re not! I used to live in LA and tried to be an actor and I always thought that phrase was very telling

The way I see it, even if they aren&#39;t actos and didn&#39;t read from a script, these people knew they wouldn&#39;t see themselves on tv or get a cut of the profit if they said anything derogatory.
....come to think of it, do they actually get a cut or just fame?

Everyone is an actor and their life is the stage

That’s their loophole...

Those Chevy commercials made sure I don’t ever buy a Chevy.

They often cast these on casting websites too. Read: subscription based websites only used by actors.

And also even if they are just normal people, they never say they didn&#39;t just pay them and tell them what to say.

Debatable 

I posted this thought months ago and you get all the karma?

Luck. I&#39;ve had posts that did poorly but then someone else posts the same thing later and does better. 

Are they though?

Debatable.

My dad always asks, when they will have “real actors, not people.”

Everytime one of those shitty Chevy commercials come on, I always mention this. Its so stupid and I&#39;m suprised this is the first time I have heard someone else other then me mention it.

Had to check to make sure you weren&#39;y dad

Ahahahahah you think that they are hoomans? Right,you continiue to think like that.
<em>Laughs in lizardmen</em>*

i don&#39;t think that darth vader or shrek are real people.

No actors, just people we pay to say stuff

Mmm. No they&#39;re not. Nice try.

I absolutely hate those Chevy commercials. They are fake AF, and anyone that says otherwise is in denial. I cringe whenever one comes on. 
Here’s a story about a person who was an actor on of the commercials. <a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5924785ee4b094cdba58376a" rel="nofollow">Story Link</a>

But how do you know?

Actors are fake humans portraying other fake humans and receiving vast over compensation. Just look at Hollyweed. 

Have you seen the way folks in Hollywood behave?  They are *<strong><em>not</em></strong>* real people

No wonder actors have such low self-esteem

Am I supposed to be impressed by the &quot;real people&quot;?  They&#39;re reciting lines that were giving to them, and are being paid, right?  Maybe less than union scale, since they&#39;re not actors?

As in they are not acting. An actor is a real person, but when they are acting, what they do isn&#39;t real.

that is indeed the statement that is being conveyed by the message

But in this case they are &quot;real people&quot; but still acting. So what&#39;s the point? 

Except for Chuck Norris, who is, of course, a god.

But not a real one
