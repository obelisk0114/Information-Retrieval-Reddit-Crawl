There was a truck commercial where dude said, &quot;I&#39;m an actor, but I&#39;m not acting.&quot;  Then he went on about how much he loved his truck.  


Beinlausi     Sun Feb 4 03:57:12 2018 UTC

Was he convincing? And if so, does that mean he is a good actor or that he was not acting?


L8Show     Sun Feb 4 04:34:17 2018 UTC

Didn&#39;t convince me.  Wish I could find it.  Was a Mexican actor in a full sized, fully loaded truck.<br/>Edit: It wasn&#39;t a group commercial like the Chevy ones they rant nationally.  It basically just him braggin about his truck.
In general all those commercials pulled people off the streets.  Some just happened to be actors lol.  Regardless of background they were told they get around $200.  Most seemed to know the more excited they acted the better their chances of getting in the commercial/get a little more money.  Cheap, and easy.  


Smigg_e     Sun Feb 4 08:02:29 2018 UTC

I think it was a Chevy commercial. 


L8Show     Sun Feb 4 17:41:56 2018 UTC

Not sure which company, but I thought it was Ford.  It wasn&#39;t one of those group Chevy commercials.  It focused on him driving around, and doing stuff.  Might have been for the Los Angeles market.  


Airazz     Sun Feb 4 12:36:59 2018 UTC

In general all those commercials pulled people off the streets. Some just happened to be actors lol.
Bullshit, they&#39;re all hired through acting agencies. Most of them have full time jobs in something other than acting, therefore they&#39;re not &quot;technically&quot; actors. 


L8Show     Sun Feb 4 17:36:56 2018 UTC

Google it.  Many were pulled off the streets with offers of $200 for their participation.  Since this was done in Los Angeles, and there&#39;s a lot of out of work actors... 


BrokenEye3     Sun Feb 4 04:38:09 2018 UTC

Now there&#39;s an idea. &quot;The people in this commercial are actors, but they&#39;re not very good ones.&quot;

Actor: a person whose profession is acting on the stage, in movies, or on television.
Acting: the art or occupation of performing in plays, movies, or television productions.
Performing: carry out, accomplish, or fulfill (an action, task, or function); present (a form of entertainment) to an audience.
Audience: the assembled spectators or listeners at a public event, such as a play, movie, concert, or meeting.
Spectators = people watching the channel
Thus, he is an actor.


rossimus     Sun Feb 4 00:53:04 2018 UTC

They are hired to appear in the commercial.  They are paid to be there.  They are given direction.  Even if they aren’t all serious professional actors in the traditional sense, they are credited as actors in the commercial.
So, are actors.  Just maybe not Actors.


Zomburger257     Sun Feb 4 00:57:38 2018 UTC

I act, therefore I am an actor 


PM_YOUR_RIG     Sun Feb 4 09:58:58 2018 UTC

Yeah I bet if it was taken to court the TV network would define actors as being members of some sort of Actors union

Keanu is the real life tragic superhero (like Spiderman) considering he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident and he has been in a &#39;be nice to everyone and treasure everything&#39; mode ever since. 


squarebacksteve     Sun Feb 4 18:42:31 2018 UTC

She was not his wife, and his daughter was not in a car crash. She was stillborn at 8mths and it caused the relationship to fall apart. I think his exgf died like a year later in a car crash. Still very sad though, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s been through a lot.

Well, the idea is that an actor isn&#39;t playing him/herself in a commercial, but rather a character. It&#39;s a role or a part, and it&#39;s not &quot;real.&quot;


DarthPiette     Sun Feb 4 05:35:42 2018 UTC

I f-ing hate Chevy simply because of their commercials. I especially hate the one where they loaded some people&#39;s families into an SUV. The purpose of the commercial is to associate good feelings about Chevy when the commercial wasn&#39;t about the SUV at all.


cuckooforcoconut     Sun Feb 4 12:30:29 2018 UTC

Have you been ignoring every commercial you’ve ever seen? All advertisements essentially try to associate happiness with the product (or promote an action through sadness)
If a product can stand on its own merit without that type of advertising, then it doesn’t need to be advertised - word of mouth alone will make the product popular. Eg Tesla. 


RazorRush     Sun Feb 4 18:54:43 2018 UTC

May be off topic but is there any backlash for the company if they tell us &quot;these are not paid actors&quot; and they are?

Actors have to be in the actors union. These real people are want to be actors on their first commercial / acting job. After this they are no longer real people.

There are guidelines used by the Screen Actors Guild that determine what a &quot;real person&quot; is and what they are allowed to say. It pretty much secures jobs for professional actors. A good example are those old Gieco commercials starring a customer and a famous person (i.e. Little Richard).
