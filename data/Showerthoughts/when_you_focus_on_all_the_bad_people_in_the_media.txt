I&#39;ve noticed during the bad parts of my life I was so focused on the people that have wronged me , and all the terrible people we hear about through social media. I began seeing everybody as wrong. The opposite of rose colored glasses. Nobody is perfect and we all have our flaws.

I think there are many more good people than bad. But bad people make much more of a dent.
