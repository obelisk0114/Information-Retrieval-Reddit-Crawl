What kind of pizza party is it if you only get two pieces? Order more pizza you heathens!

Really, this. It&#39;s honestly considered  a bit rude if you eat too little.

Unless you happen to order from one of those lame pizza shops that cut the pizza into little rectangles.
<em>Those</em> sumbitches want to watch the world burn by denying every slice its own share of crust.

Fuck pizza crust. Square center pieces for LIFE.

Philistine!
Everyone knows the crust is the best part. If the crust sucks, you need to get a better pizza place.

No, ALL crust sucks. Not just pizza. 
Fuck bread crust. Fuck pizza crust. Fuck any brownie that isn’t cut directly from the center of the pan.
