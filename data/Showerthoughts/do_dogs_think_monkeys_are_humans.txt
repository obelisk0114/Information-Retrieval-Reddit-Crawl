Some of the people I&#39;m sitting next to on the subway unfortunately share the same odor...

Capture them, tame them, train them, then the tearful release. You&#39;ll be doing us all a service

My dog can tell the difference between a treat and a treat with medicine inside of it just by looks and smell...... Pretty sure I’m gonna go with a ‘no’ on this one.

My dog thought he himself was human. Kept trying to cross the road by himself...
