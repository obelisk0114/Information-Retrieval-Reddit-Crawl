What&#39;s going on in your showers?? ðŸ¤”


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 19:01:11 2018 UTC

Whaddaya mean, mate?
Edit: Oh, I get it.  Yeah, I think about things like this whilst showering.  I actually really enjoy my career.  Unfortunately, most of the stuff I know is boring...yet, it&#39;s also stuff that educates you youngsters about where your money goes and WHY YOU SHOULD QUESTION EVERYTHING.  EVERYTHING, I TELL YOU!!!


noolesscluebie     Sun Feb 4 19:05:08 2018 UTC

Lol!  I ain&#39;t so young, but I rarely spend my time in the shower thinking about work; too much time spent that way anyway


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 19:09:05 2018 UTC

I should take this advice.
I won&#39;t, but I should.


sonicjesus     Sun Feb 4 19:08:45 2018 UTC

It&#39;s the same whether you use the chip or the swipe, it&#39;s just a question of whether it&#39;s processed as a debit or credit. Someone pays either way. 


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 19:12:50 2018 UTC

How do you not understand that it actually really matters who is paying the fee.
You go to mom and pop grocer, you enter your pin, that mom and pop saves 2-5% of your total purchase and gets to recognize it as revenue, further encouraging their existence as a mom and pop grocer.
You enter your pin here, and Chase bank, Wells Fargo, all those big fuckers with giant pockets, basically, pay that 2-5%.  And THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO SO.
You go to your local chain grocery store, why the fuck aren&#39;t they discounting your purchase 2-5% when you enter your pin.  1) they&#39;re already corporate so they have the pockets to dip from, and 2) they&#39;re already corporate SO THEY HAVE THE POCKETS TO DIP FROM.  How the hell does Fred Meyer have the RIGHT to demand MY PIN with every chip purchase.  Yet, other retailers that have the chip reader, GET TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CREDIT OR DEBIT PURCHASES.  There&#39;s so much to this.  I don&#39;t even have the time to spell it out for you.  I want to have the time, but I really don&#39;t want to spend it right now.  Please try to figure this out for yourself.  Consider it an assignment.  Report to me your findings and I&#39;ll guide you thereafter.
Why aren&#39;t my purchases from Kroger discounted 2-5 fucking % when I use my pin.  Because they&#39;re greedy cunts, and they can be, because we allow it.

Dumb dumb, youâ€™re wrong.... the fee is always paid by the merchant and ranges from roughly 1.75-3.4% depending on what the card type and processor fees.  Never above 4% and always applicable 


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 19:53:44 2018 UTC

Perhaps you&#39;ve heard of our lord and savior, American Express.  They have the highest fees of all merchants.  
&quot;The fee is always paid by the merchant.&quot;  What the fuck does that even mean?  Did you typo, and you meant retailer instead of merchant?  Because, if so, NO.  You are wrong.  The fee is paid by the bank for debit, by the retailer for credit.

The chip is just to add the Pin for extra security. The retailer still has to pay the credit card and debit processing fees. 


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 18:24:20 2018 UTC

Not for debit.  They sure don&#39;t.


Omck4heroes     Sun Feb 4 18:36:10 2018 UTC

As a retailer, yes I do


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 18:44:14 2018 UTC

As a corporate accountant, I <em>know</em> that you do not.
The retailer only pay fees on transactions processed as credit card.  
For all transactions processed by debit card, the consumer&#39;s bank pays the fees, NOT the retailer.
This is why retailers PUSH us consumers to enter our pin.  By doing so, the consumer&#39;s bank pays the fees, and the retailer profits more from the transaction.


Omck4heroes     Sun Feb 4 18:45:43 2018 UTC

And yet, using Square as I do, whether the card is chip or not, they are all charged as credit, and thus I still pay the fee.


fuhksaik     Sun Feb 4 18:49:58 2018 UTC

If the consumer enters the pin, there is no fee for the retailer.
What you&#39;ve described sounds accurate enough - when you process transactions from online sales there is no pin entered.  All transactions are processed as credit, so the fees make sense.
In reality, the non-virtual kind, entering your pin means the retailer makes more from you.


Omck4heroes     Sun Feb 4 18:53:45 2018 UTC

They never enter their pins. Our chip reader scans all sales as credit, hence the fee


bnby_eclipse     Sun Feb 4 19:41:56 2018 UTC

The retailer pays the card processing company to interact with the Bank that issued the debit card; or Visa/MC, and get the money into your clients accounts- they donâ€™t perform that action for free. 
Generally for debit transactions there is a fee of 5~15cents and for credit 1.5~3%. The fee depends on the amount of volume the company processes (walmart pays a lot less per transaction than a mom and pop shop). Chip transactions will also usually be a bit less due to higher security and less of a chance that the bank is going to pay out for a fraud charge - but there is still a fee.

Invite Destiny&#39;s Child into your shower and you won&#39;t think about credit fees again<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7v43ky/comment/dtpgi69?st=JD95W9A6&amp;sh=1ec919cf" rel="nofollow">source</a> 


druthurston     Sun Feb 4 19:56:46 2018 UTC

Merchant=retailer... same thing.  Banks donâ€™t pay for debit transactions, there is a small fee charged to the merchant for debit- typically 25 cents.

<em>Merchant fees</em> are the fees paid by the <em>retailer</em> for the privilege to accept credit/debit cards as methods of payment by the <em>consumer</em>.
Is that clear, or should I translate to English?

You don&#39;t get a discount for paying cash either. Get mad! Protest! Boycott all stores! 


ibitthehedgehog     Sun Feb 4 18:16:14 2018 UTC

Thatâ€™s due to price elasticity.
