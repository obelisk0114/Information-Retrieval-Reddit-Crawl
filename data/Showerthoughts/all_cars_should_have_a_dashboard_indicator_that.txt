They kind of do, it is the blinker.  If your right blinker is blinking much faster than normal, it is telling you the front or back signal light is out on the right.

It still surprises me at how many people have never been told this. It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re keeping it a secret.

It won&#39;t tell you that you have a brake light or taillight out, if the signal light is separate from the brake light.

Mine does. Part of the canbus system. It&#39;ll even tell me the specific light which has burnt out.

The cannabis system will tell you the specific people which has burnt out.

My old ass Volvo beater tells me if I&#39;m not mistaken


Idiot_Savant_Tinker     Sun Feb 4 03:04:18 2018 UTC

I had a 1995 Jeep that would tell you a light was out, and would show you which one on a little overlay of the jeep.

Most cars indicator would flicker faster if there is a problem with the lights.

First time I read I thought you said cars should have a dashboard light if your tailgating...which would also be a great idea.

Also, if you suddenly loose your instrument cluster lights, that means your brake lights are out. Or it used to.


NerfHerderEarl     Sun Feb 4 08:18:14 2018 UTC

Yup, dash lights are almost always on the same circuit as tail lights.  If your dash lights aren&#39;t working you better check your tail lights.

I’m the proud owner of a 1984 MR30 Skyline. One day, whenever I pushed the brake, a small little light turned on my dash. It also decided to pop on when my lights were on. After a confusing month of trying to figure out what the light was trying to tell me, my mechanic lets me know one of my 4 taillights have blown. A few days later I finally make the connection. I have a taillight dead warning light in my dash cluster. 
TL;DR: Old Skylines have them. Took me a bit to realise it.

RS turbo?


QuitE___     Sun Feb 4 11:34:21 2018 UTC

Nah. L24e. Show car in the future is the plan and maybe a couple pounds of boost to top it off. 


Hohohoju     Sun Feb 4 12:43:05 2018 UTC

And then what if the light on the dashboard blows out?


CySnark     Sun Feb 4 19:39:27 2018 UTC

Then the tail lights should blink.


AccidentallyTheCable     Sun Feb 4 05:03:43 2018 UTC

Mine does. 83 mustang


Yank2005     Sun Feb 4 06:20:44 2018 UTC

Most do these days


Anthony_014     Sun Feb 4 06:37:02 2018 UTC

2008 BMW M3 here. There is a alert that comes up on the Idrive system/nav screen whenever ANY light is out. Passenger brake light for example.. &quot;passenger brake light malfunction, use caution.&quot; Or some shit.


SquishyHumanoid     Sun Feb 4 06:37:24 2018 UTC

SAABs were doing this ages ago. My 17 yo SAAB had this. Why is everyone so behind on safety? RIP SAAB


lemoncake51     Sun Feb 4 10:18:16 2018 UTC

most modern cars do. 


TorbenBusk     Sun Feb 4 11:51:41 2018 UTC

As in All VW&#39;s, Audi&#39;s, Skoda&#39;s and Seat&#39;s


MissGrafin     Sun Feb 4 11:57:02 2018 UTC

My 15’ Cherokee displays a little “rear passenger lamp” (or whatever lamp is out) message in the dash. My 98 Patriot just displays “check lamp” when there is an issue. 
My sister has a 16’ Buick Enclave. She gets e-mails when something is wrong.
