Usually they get carried


17csteele     Sun Feb 4 19:38:53 2018 UTC

I guess I didnâ€™t really think about that ðŸ˜…

Die

Wheel chair user here. I haven&#39;t had to deal with a fire yet, but was on a 3rd floor in a hotel while the elevator was busted. I turned around backwards and held the handrails and bumped down in my chair, went to the desk and told them that they needed to fix the elevator, and headed to the continental breakfast.

Yet? Hopefully you don&#39;t ever get caught in a fire, that&#39;s probably one of the scariest places to be.


klimb75     Mon Feb 5 00:50:23 2018 UTC

Yeah, I hope to avoid them but it&#39;s nice to know I can get down in a hurry.

At my last job, there was a special evacuation chair to help get them down the stairs.  Could have made that work in a pinch but couldnâ€™t imagine having to use it in any sizable building.

I thought of it cause I live in a dorm with 12 floors and the first floor has no living space on it

Our senior living building residents are instructed to wait in the stairwell if they need firefighters/police to assist with their evacuation

It&#39;s not hard going down stairs in a wheelchair it&#39;s just going to hurt a lot

My first thought was roll out a window, or drag your self out one. I live in a 1.5 story house we often worry about fires it&#39;s a very old house. We tell my daughter that if she can&#39;t get down the stairs to jump out her window, our roof is right there though, so I know that this wouldn&#39;t be possible for all situations as they might be more likely to die, but a lot of people without use of their legs have a lot of upper body strength, &amp; if there is an option I&#39;m sure they will take it. Although I work in the caregiver field &amp; have been through some fake evacuations, we did help by taking them down elevators, &amp; also the firemen did carry a few people down the stairs, in a fake evacuation I did in school where we pretended to be the students pretended to be the patients so as not to put the patients through something they don&#39;t have too.

Roll


jacksonononon     Sun Feb 4 22:28:10 2018 UTC

Stop drop and roll? 


johnboy11a     Sun Feb 4 22:33:45 2018 UTC

If it&#39;s a standard evacuation (jot flames rolling out windows and such...) and the building staff/fire dept sees it safe to do so, they will use the elevators for those who really need them.  The lazy people can take the stairs.
If it&#39;s really a rocking mess, they are getting carried down the stairs...hopefully carefully!

Accept their fate, I dunno.
