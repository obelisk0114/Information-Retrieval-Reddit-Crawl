Concepts of true and false are made by humans in the first place, and only apply to the language, so there are as many options as we made, because the laws of true/false were made by us in the first place.
Also Turing believed that judgements can be probable, apart from true and false

the universe operates on things being true and false - and all variants inbetween - all at the same time.

But what about variants outside?

outside what ?

outside true or false, we’ve based this whole conclusion within true or false. Our laws have defined everything within it, what I’ve been wondering is about options outside of it.

I like the idea of 5 choices: Yes, No, Maybe, Maybe Not, Neutral.
