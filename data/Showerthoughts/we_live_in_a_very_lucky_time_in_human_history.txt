If you rode public transit you wouldn&#39;t have the same opinion.

Be like a dog and stick your head out the window.

This is a fabulous shower thought. Clean execution.

Primary school teacher here, writing to let you know that 32 people in a small classroom in the middle of the summer disagree with you. 
Although, it&#39;s likely that only 1 of the 32 people in that class are aware of it.

On the second or so day of 5th grade the teacher told us she forgot to put something on the school supplies list and we all needed to go home and tell our parents we need deodorant.  Havenâ€™t skipped a day since!

Imagine if humans had a bloodhound sense of smell. What a curse that would be. How would we adapt to it?

You&#39;re wrong

Not lucky at all. If the human race lives on for, say, 2000 years longer there is a 99.999% chance for any given human born AFTER today
