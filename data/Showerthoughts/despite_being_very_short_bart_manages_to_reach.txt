When I was a kid that was part of the punishment. They gave you that big heavy foldout stool your grandma had and you had to manually push it every few words. It wasn&#39;t until you were a good 3/4 of the way down before you could do it from the floor. It was utterly exhausting getting up and down hundreds of times. 
God I hated school.

It always amazes me how they take the most disenfranchised kids and subject them to the most disenfranchising punishments.

it&#39;s almost like they&#39;re trying to teach children that the world is vindictive and full of assholes who don&#39;t give a shit about you.

So... like Verizon dsl tech support?

People who don&#39;t give a shit about you don&#39;t punish you either though.

That’s why you gotta write vertically. “I will I will I will” “not eat glue not eat glue not eat glue”

I used to get told off for doing that. 


PowderPhysics     Sun Feb 4 22:42:53 2018 UTC

I never got caught

We just used the multi-chalk-holder from music class to write 5 lines at a time. Would take like 5 min to fill 2 chalk boards. 


OrangeFaygo836     Sun Feb 4 22:22:29 2018 UTC

I remember the bench, and I remember the busted 4 chalk holder deal, that did not work as good as you thought, but you had to check it whenever you were stuck writing on the wrap around chalk boards in some of the older Chicago Public Schools T_T

Someone please tell me how writing something all over a chalkboard ingrained it in the kids head as an <em>action</em> rather than a <em>punishment</em>


NeonDisease     Sun Feb 4 21:26:09 2018 UTC

Clearly the adults who do this kind of stuff weren&#39;t ever children themselves.

Its a pretty good deterrent, I never broke the crayons again after.


bleedy_dick     Sun Feb 4 22:55:05 2018 UTC

How is making the kid mow the lawn or clean the dishes again becaise it wasn&#39;t good enough the first time a punishment? Because they have to do something annoying that they don&#39;t want to do in their free time. 


QuickShort     Sun Feb 4 21:33:29 2018 UTC

He also manages to write legibly on his own butt.

The Simpsons have become so iconic that no one even needs to ask what this confession was referring to.

why he always in trouble tho?


johnroben98     Sun Feb 4 21:59:56 2018 UTC

Cause he&#39;s Bart.


Venkman007     Sun Feb 4 23:34:38 2018 UTC

We don&#39;t know or see that Bart used a stool or ladder.....


forgivenfreeonfire     Mon Feb 5 01:02:01 2018 UTC

He&#39;s probably using that thingy with the five chalks, not the stupid way.
