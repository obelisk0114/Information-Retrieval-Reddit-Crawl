I don&#39;t know why but I read that as &quot;floppy handjob&quot; the first time

Damn auto correct

No doubt. I believe in it so much that I&#39;ve asked to redo a handshake before. Sometimes there&#39;s awkward handshakes, and I know they know, so I&#39;ll laugh about it and say let&#39;s try that again to avoid getting off on the wrong foot.

I like this idea. You&#39;re coolü§ù

There‚Äôs no reason for any handshakes in this day and age. How often is an acquaintance hiding a weapon in their sleeves with the intent to murder you? 


GDogg69     Sun Feb 4 19:29:10 2018 UTC

Too often to be fair. 


FunnyID     Sun Feb 4 18:05:35 2018 UTC

An injured hand is a good reason.


IshaanDewan     Sun Feb 4 18:44:44 2018 UTC

What was the reason earlier?

Scurvy??
