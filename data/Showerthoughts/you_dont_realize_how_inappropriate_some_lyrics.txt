Take me to the Candy Shop~
I&#39;ll let you lick the lollipop~

I used to be a nanny for a kid who would sing his own version of this. &quot;Take me to the Candy Shop, I&#39;ll let you lick my pork chop.&quot; 

At least he kept the message the same

It also still rhymed. So he was able to respect the poetry of the song. 

I was at a housing project with a church group putting on a halloween party for the kids. I&#39;d given a child, probably in kindergarten, a sucker and he started singing &quot;lick it like a loli-pop.&quot; I&#39;m standing there shocked and he&#39;s like &quot;what, it&#39;s a song?&quot;

I used to sing this is fifth grade. For some reason I always put a Jamaican accent on it and turned it into a reggae song

I was the little kid sing this to my stepmom. I had no idea, I imagine she did.

Smack that, all on the floorSmack that, give me some more.
SMACK WHAT?! SOME MORE WHAT?!

That of course.

Ahhhh middle school memories

Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Right right, I see

I&#39;m a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit guy, actually. 

No thanks, I like mine without the AIDS.

Where else do you get your kids?

I mean, I make my own. Tastes better when you&#39;ve got the satisfaction of making it from scratch.

Oh my God. We went from pedophile to incest. I love it.

People never say that to me in real life. It&#39;s good to be appreciated for once.

Or pedophilia to cannibalism... Don&#39;t know how you went to incest. I mean I do know but thats a darker path I feel

Why not both?

Incest! Fun for the whole family!

Lol do you eat babies 

Nah, they gotta grow up a bit before I eat &#39;em.

your wasting the good stuff.. ever see snowpeircer?

Forget about me

Hey little child come here! I want to play a song for you to see if it makes me feel uncomfortable as you learn the words and begin to sing along. üôã

Hey GildedVulture! Have a seat right there! My name is Chris Hansen, How do you fare? I&#39;m from dateline NBC, now listen here and follow me.

You don&#39;t use your pick up artist moves to get some young tail?

Sounds like my kind of Saturday

Five years ago, age 33, hanging out with a friend of mine, I don‚Äôt know, smoking weed probably, and he randomly broke news that he bought 2 tickets to see Lil Wane (AKA ‚ÄúYoung Weezey,‚Äù former front man/founder of the dirty South Hip-Hop super group...Hot Boys) anyway, live at the Key Arena, sold out show. Will I go? Sure. Why not?Well, because I didn‚Äôt know that ‚ÄúWeezey‚Äôs‚Äù core fan base was millions of middle-class suburban white people, mostly tweens, and their parents. 3:1 ratio. There was no beer, and not enough weed. 

Maybe they got in the wrong car

You don&#39;t realize how inappropriate some titles of Reddit posts are until there&#39;s a person calling out OP in the comment section

You‚Äôve obviously never heard your 3 year old son proudly yell, ‚ÄúI started a fucking war!‚Äù while head banging. We were simultaneously proud and saying, ‚Äúok, don‚Äôt ever EVER say that at school. Or to your Oma.‚Äù

How was this upvoted 1.7k times? :/

Because it‚Äôs a class post...

But the lyrics are still the worst part about this situation

One of my violent femmes albums starts off with an intro that says ‚Äúyou can not fuck with this band.‚Äù When my youngest was 2 or so she wanted to listen to the violent femmes and shouted ‚Äúi want to fuck this band!‚Äù 
Her father forbid me from listening to that band with her in the car after that.

Typical groupie

I&#39;d be DTF.
To fuck the band or the equipment. I mean, anything&#39;s  a vagina if you&#39;re brave enough. Hell, even the disc works.

And somehow out of an entire song, they know how to repeat mainly just the &quot;bad&quot; lyrics.

ocean man

Take me by the hand

Lead me to the land

that you understand 

Ocean man

The voyage to the corner of the world is a real trip.

Trip trip trip trip...

Ocean man,

the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand¬†

Running out of oxygen down there, alone

Maybe the &quot;bad lyrics&quot; are usually in the chorus?

Cake by the ocean floor

Whoop dat ass just got banned at my house after I played whoomp there it is for my children

My friends 9 year old daughter loves the Katy Perry Peacock song. She would walk around the house like &quot;I WANNA TOUCH YOUR PEACOCK- COCK&quot;. her mom told us its a song about a bird and not to dare tell her otherwise. 

That&#39;s going to be a hilarious thing to remind her about, when she&#39;s old enough to know the truth. 

She knows the truth

You have no idea how right you are.

How dare you. Maybe I&#39;m the 9 year old daughter of the friend of <a href="/u/domestic_omnom">u/domestic_omnom</a>. You dont know how right I know I am. 

So right you voted for trump.

Work with 9 year olds. She‚Äôs heard of a ‚Äúcock‚Äù before and has some semblance of an idea of what it refers to‚Äîdepending on her level and explicitness of playground banter.  Kids always know more than we give them credit for.

That seems risky to encourage your daughter to sing those lyrics...

It&#39;s all fun and games until it gets screamed in the grocery store.

Then you can have a jolly old time calling the fucking cops as old men offer lollipops.

Had to look that song up to make sure it was real. I don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m surprised anymore. I don&#39;t know how much worse or better it is than my self singing &quot;I&#39;m Horny so horny horny horny&quot; when I was young

Same here, it was one of my favourite songs, but I didn&#39;t know what horny meant at the time. 

Are you guys talking about the song from the Chef&#39;s Aid cd?

Wait til she sings it out loud at school or grocery store or family dinner. 

Such class that young woman has

Is it me or am I the only one to think it&#39;s wrong to like to children like this ? ....and why do we do it ? 

I have a video when my daughter was 3 singing &quot;what the fuck say&quot;  whats the fox say?

In a similar situation my 6th grade teacher brought her probably 4 or 5 year old son to class one day and told us to ask which character from Sesame Street was his favorite.
&quot;Kermit the fuck!&quot;
Entire class hits the floor.

I‚Äôm glad your teacher had a sense of humor.

Just the opposite with my son when he was 3 or 4. Scorpions Rock You Like A Hurricane is on and he sings, &quot;The fish is hungry&quot; instead of bitch. 

Huh. I always though it was finch. Guess I never listened too hard.

There aren&#39;t enough lyrics about finches.

Oml

Barbie girl.
3 groups of kids sang it in my 2nd grade talent show.
The adults said nothing.
Years later you realize it is NOT to be sang by children.

This song was rampant in my school when I was in third grade. We understood what we were singing considerably better than the adults seemed to realize.

Anyone explain?

Basically the Barbie girl song is &quot;adult.
Some of lyrics mention her saying she&#39;s your doll and can touch and undress her.
Also calls herself a blond bimbo mentions hanky panky and more.
Full lyrics are here if you wanna see how not child friendly it is &gt;_&lt;

Mind you it isn&#39;t a bad song (super catchy) just not something children should sing in front of ppl..

I&#39;m a barbie girl

It&#39;s fantastic.

Imagination

My little sister was obsessed with Grease growing up. 6-8 year old singing about pussy wagons, endlessly entertaining. 

So much of that movie flew above my head when I was young. Then there was a period where every time I watched it, I picked up more and more. Somehow I literally missed Danny <em>grabbing Sandy right on the tit</em> when I was a kid even though it is far from subtle.

&quot;Did she put up a fight...&quot; WTF I never really noticed that.

Was my favorite movie when I was 8, was obsessed for probably about a year. Sadly I remember figuring out what &quot;flog your log&quot; meant by context but the whole &quot;chicks&#39;ll cream&quot; thing flew over my head for years to come.

My 4yo niece‚Äôs favorite song is Pour Some Sugar On Me, she requests/sings along whenever we listen to music.  Always hilarious. 

Aha my 12 year old son&#39;s favorite song is Cocaine by Eric Clapton lol. He always requests it when we&#39;re doing cocaine

Yeah, you don&#39;t want kids doing cocaine alone. It&#39;s important to teach them moderation.

Yeah, possible.

They can&#39;t OD if I&#39;ve already nosed all the snow!

Otherwise they fall out of the windows of a high rise.
<em>I‚Äôm ashamed</em>

It&#39;s good that you do it with your son, really helps you bond

Ah yes, quality parent-son bonding time. I usually prefer smoking Tide Pods with my children, but cocaine is always a good alternative 

It&#39;s you new age parents that are the real problem here, you have to instill an appreciation for the classics first.

Yes, indeed. We must appreciate the classic &quot;Cocaine with your Kids&quot; before jumping into the Tide Pod smoking with them. I can&#39;t express this enough, try the originals before moving on

My shit, has been lost. 

Lol&#39;d and spit on my screen. Thanks for that

Awwww how cute.. wait...

My kids thought it was &quot;Cookie&quot; and keep asking for it. The first time I was really confused, now I love it.

If only Eric Clapton had followed your example.

Oof

That guitar solo is slick tho yo

Lol that&#39;s hilarious, I would like to see that haha. 

You win everything!

My favorite song when I was a child was &quot;Big Balls&quot; by AC/DC. They didn&#39;t tell me it was inappropriate until I sang it to the babysitter. 

What&#39;s inappropriate about hosting large formal dances?

The social pages say they are the largest formal dances of all

Big, full, balls that everyone comes to.

For my 21st birthday, I got Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Jazz (by Queen) records. My mom didn&#39;t realize how dirty they both were until I pointed it out

My 5 year old has been obsessed with that song for the last year or so, I love it. She knows what she can and can&#39;t sing along to (AC/DC and Zeppelin are generally fine, Kiss tends to be a bit more questionable) and it hasn&#39;t been an issue yet. She also LOVES Cherry Pie, by Warrant... I&#39;m not sure I should be letting her sing it, but oh well. She knows not to sing it around her grandmother. It&#39;s better than the Frozen soundtrack on repeat!

My 5yo neice sings Genie in a Bottle on a loop whenever we go on a drive! Cringe time begins!

My daughter is two and her favorite record is The Dead Milkmen. I‚Äôm the mean mom that put a stop to that before her tradition of singing Disney songs at Publix turns into ‚ÄúBitchin Camaro‚Äù or ‚ÄúTiny Town‚Äù. 

Hearing a 6 year old singing &quot;gotta eat the booty like groceries&quot; really hits you hard.

Pretty sure we&#39;ve always been pervs. Read this sonnet by Shakespeare, keeping in mind that in those days, &quot;will&quot; also referred to the author&#39;s name <em>and</em> was slang for both the male and female sex organs:  <blockquote>
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,<br/>And Will to boot, and Will in over-plus;<br/>More than enough am I that vexed thee still,<br/>To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br/>Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<br/>Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br/>Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br/>And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br/>The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br/>And in abundance addeth to his store;<br/>So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will<br/>One will of mine, to make thy large will more.<br/>   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;<br/>   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.

Read song of Solomon in the bible. It&#39;s basically Solomon begging this hot girl to have sex with him. He in extreme poetic detail describes every aspect of her body.

Alright kids, time to read our daily bible passage!
Welp, we&#39;re atheists now. Time to go fap to this book!

The most Christian thing that may or may not come from an actual Christian I&#39;ve heard all day

Well I am a Christian, but I was only making reference to the meme...

One of my brothers (5) kids, a 6 year old girl announced to their entire church that her favorite song was &quot;save a horse ride a cowboy&quot;... And followed it up with a dance while yelling &quot;I&#39;ll ride a cowboy, I love horses&quot;
All of this was unsolicited, during the pastors weekly &quot;greet the congregation&quot; in which he walks around and asks a handful if people how they are doing, if they or a loved one needs prayers.... But, she saw the microphone and went with it.... She&#39;s a firecracker. 
Old ladies were appalled. ..........
....They don&#39;t go to that church anymore. 

Huh. Sounds like a pretty good day all things considered.
Time to go to church and give a little speech, eh? I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love it. And no, I will not reveal what &#39;it&#39; refers to.., for the faint of heart, of course.

Can‚Äôt believe that song was on the radio for months. 

Lol God&#39;s light thats funny!

Lol

Man you strayed too far when you started ducking with Omarion. This could have been prevented.

When I was but a wee lad whenever the song &quot;Get Low&quot; by Lil Jon would play me and my mom would sing it together in the car. She didn&#39;t know the words and I had no idea what <blockquote>
Til the sweat drop down my balls
Til all these bitches crawl
Til all skeet skeet motherfuckers, all skeet skeet god damn!
meant, because I was like 9. Sometimes we would sing this together while pulling up to my school, and we would wonder why we got weird looks from other parents.

Earlier today, my wife and I made our infant dance to this song. We got about halfway through singing this until we realized just how bad it is. He does love his arms moved from the window to the wall, though.

<a href="https://youtu.be/nsSTDFyYvc4" rel="nofollow">Sandra Bullock does a great cover</a>. Lol

That&#39;s adorable. 

Dave Chapelle really changed my propensity to sing this at the top of my lungs.

‚ô™ have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire ‚ô™ 

Yep once I heard my little cousin sing &quot;whips and chains excite me&quot; it snapped. 

I heart that song today and only just realized how dirty it was... My goodness I sang it as a child as well!

There is a collection of lullaby-itized versions of popular songs, called Rockabye Baby. It‚Äôs on Spotify and it‚Äôs like baby versions of The Beatles, P!nk, Iron Maiden, etc. 
Some of them sound good but others don‚Äôt really translate well (like the Muse album sucks imo). Anyway my favorite one to put on for my daughter is the Sublime album. There‚Äôs no words in any of these albums but it still feels wrong to listen to, considering Sublime‚Äôs material is about handjobs, heroin, violence, and other things of that nature XD

I sang Blister in the Sun to my niece when she was a baby, cuz it was the only song I could think of that I knew a decent portion of the lyrics to. 

That&#39;s beautiful.

I cringed when I heard Flo Rida&#39;s Whistle on the radio for the first time

I was old enough to understand whistle, but I  was so happy because I was like &quot;finally a clean song&quot; I didn&#39;t realize the song was so dirty... I thought it was about whistling, I was at least 17 when that song came out .... 

I remember Madonna had some song called, give it to me&quot; where the music video has her fighting for some luggage or some shit. I spent a long long time before one day I heard the song at a party and realised that she wanted something else.

Holy shit it‚Äôs just now I realized how dirty that song is

I thought it was pretty obvious

I was around the age of ten I thought he was teaching me how to whistle 

How To Whistle 101: The Proper Way

I got you if anyone need lessons tbh 

I see, fair enough I guess

Shit I was here thinking you&#39;re a youngster and I&#39;m not much older

Wait...how is it dirty?

Go girl you can work itLet me see your whistle while you work itI&#39;ma lay it back, don&#39;t stop it&#39;Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it, on meNow, shorty let that whistle blowYeah, baby let that whistle blow
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle babyLet me knowGirl I&#39;m gonna show you how to do itAnd we start real slowYou just put your lips togetherAnd you come real closeCan you blow my whistle baby, whistle babyHere we go

Oh.

I realised it when I watched Song in Real Life.

Oh shit 

On radio Disney with children doing the vocals. üòë 

&quot;It&#39;s not smut, it&#39;s Radio Disney!&quot;

Oh god

My nephew loved that one. He&#39;s 6. 

It warms the cockles of my dead frozen heart when my 3yo demands Nothing else matters as her lullabye

&quot;cockles&quot;<h1>WHOMST&#39;D&#39;VE</h1>

I laughed, you&#39;re off the hook

Mission complete.

That song can put me to sleep sometimes

The chord progressions are actually very relaxing.

Couldn&#39;t be much more from the heart

Forever trusting who we are

And nothing else matters

My 6 year old... &quot;I went to a party last Saturday night. I didn&#39;t get laid, I got in a fight...&quot;
Lord. 

It ain‚Äôt no big thing

I heard a 6yo singing &quot;all my friends are wasted&quot; the other day... They start so early these days

Afternoon delight. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CJ2wUhPtYM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CJ2wUhPtYM</a>

I&#39;m freaking 47 years old and just realized what that song was about. Imma noob.

You would appreciate the scene in Arrested Development then

Afternoon delight. Great scene.

Something something incest.

I work as a nanny for some kids who demand explanations for every line in a song. This has made me very cautious about musical choices, but one of my go-to lullabies is Kokomo by the Beach Boys. The second verse includes the phrase &quot;afternoon delight / cocktails and moonlit nights.&quot; I decided to sing it as &quot;afternoon <em>daylight</em>,&quot; to avoid having to explain that one. 
Unfortunately, I forgot that the next line includes the phrase &quot;tropical contact high.&quot;

Came here for this. Was not disappointed.

I was amazed that &quot;Shut Up And Drive&quot; by Rihanna was allowed into <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>.

&quot;Bounce&quot; by System of a Down into Secret Life of Pets trailer. Unsure of actual movie, never saw.

That same clip was in the movie. IIRC that song is about an orgy? Anyway don‚Äôt bother wasting your time watching that movie if you‚Äôre not 2 years old. 

I brought my pogo stick just to show them a trick she had so many friends.

But just one pogo stick. 

They lined up double quick but just one pogo stick

I have a 2 1/2 year old so guess not ruling that out lol..
Yeah song about an Orgy.

I don&#39;t think so.

Good choice...I have never fallen asleep in a movie theater but I did during that movie. I‚Äôm just glad I was with a friend who worked there so it didn‚Äôt cost anything. 

<em>cough</em> It Wasn&#39;t Me <em>cough</em> 

Never paid attention until last year when I saw a guy doing sort of a mannequin challenge hiding his other girl from her gf, then it all just came to me

I remember my ten year old niece singing Alanis Morissette&#39;s &quot;... will she go down on you in a theatre?&quot; verse.
Cracked me up.

I stole that album from my mom when I was too young to understand what it meant. She did not like me singing along with it.

Last night my wife found out that I let my 8 year old son listen to Peaches by The Presidents Of The United States.   She forbid me from ever letting him listen to it again.
Today in the car, it was the second song that came on the station I had on.<br/>This is pretty much our conversation while listening to it:
Him: I don&#39;t get why mommy won&#39;t let me listen to this song. It&#39;s only about peaches.
Me: I don&#39;t get it either, kiddo.  Nothing wrong with liking peaches.
Him:  Well... I don&#39;t like peaches, bit I like this song.
Me: Me too, it&#39;s a gopd song. 
About a minute later...
Him: This guy must really like peaches.
Me: (trying not to laugh) Yup, I&#39;m sure he does.
Him: But why would he want a million peaches?
Me:  Dunno, kiddo.... I hope you remember this conversation when your older.
Him: What?
Me: Nothing...

The song Peaches isn&#39;t actually sexual though. There is one line that has some innuendo, but outside of that the song is actually talking about the fruit.

Now Teaches of Peaches on the other hand...

Huh?

What?

Right.

Uh.

, but outside of that the song is actually talking about the fruit.
<em>Peaches come from a can</em>
<em>They were put there by a man</em>
<em>In a factory downtoooooown</em>
Coming from a band whose acronym suggested drug use, I assumed they were just stoned and fascinated by peaches.
I mean, the taste? The texture? Stoners dream fruit right there.

That&#39;s awesome, Im gonna use that against my wife mext time she brings it up!

If you want to give her something straight from the horse&#39;s mouth, here&#39;s what Chris Ballew (POTUSOA frontman) said about the origins of the song:<blockquote>
It was written about a girl I had a crush on. I went to her house to tell her and waited all day but she never showed up. She lived in a bright yellow house in a gray industrial part of town, and she had a peach tree in the yard. I sat there all day with peaches falling and rotting and never got to see her.
So it&#39;s actually a fairly innocent song about sitting under a peach tree while crushing on a girl.

I came here to post about Peaches too, but my revelation came as I was chaperoning a youth group mission trip....

Ive always thought thats what it was about...that he liked Peaches, it was just a weird catchy song. What&#39;s the actual meaning behind the song?

And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature&#39;s candy in my hand or can or a pie
It&#39;s about moving to the country and eating a lot of peaches.

I poked my finger down inside
This is the only line that is even vaguely sexual.
The song was inspired by the author sitting under a peach tree and smashing fallen peaches while waiting for a girl he had a crush on. Applying a sexual message to the song because of one line is just as silly as the people who claim the song is about the beauty of Marxism.

The point is that the sexuality of that line makes the rest of the lyrics dirty, which I&#39;m sure is intentional. That and the fact that peach is already used as a euphimism by a lot of people.

The point is that the sexuality of that line makes the rest of the lyrics dirty
That line isn&#39;t even inherently sexual though. Just because one line <em>could</em> be interpreted sexually it doesn&#39;t make the song sexual.<blockquote>
which I&#39;m sure is intentional
It isn&#39;t. The author has explained the origin of the song, and it isn&#39;t sexual.

ermahgerd 

I think that&#39;s a case of <em>honni soit qui mal y pense</em>. No offense to your lady, but what exactly does <em>she</em> think the song is bad for?

Like &quot;save a horse ride a cowboy&quot; I just thought it was about getting piggy back rides but apparently not

You too??? I used to sing it all the time when I was little, my mom got worried and asked what I thought it meant. I answered with piggy back rides. She agreed, and continued to let me listen to it 

4-year-old Dearest Daughter was singing Alejandro- &quot;Don&#39;t wanna kiss, don&#39;t wanna touch Just smoke my cigarette and hush&quot;.  Um.  To be fair, ever since she went to the Burger Boogaloo punk show in Oakland she&#39;s taken to taking off her shirt and running around topless yelling &quot;I&#39;m Iggy Pop!  I&#39;m Iggy Pop!&quot;  I can&#39;t decide if all of this is awesome or if CPS is on the way.

Running around topless wanting to be Iggy Pop is fucking awesome, in my humble mom opinion. Just don&#39;t give her any broken beer bottles lol

Oh god my three year old loves Lady Gaga and it&#39;s really uncomfortable when that song with &quot;I wanna take a ride on your disco stick&quot; comes on. ALEXA SKIP THIS SONG. Of course she has no idea that it&#39;s sexual but I&#39;d rather not hear her repeating that one.

It&#39;s wierd hearing 6yos on the city bus singing &quot;n*****&quot; and shit, like wtf.

Barbie girl

Or until you replay a song you used to love when you were a kid and suddenly realize what it means

Yes! When I was five, Christina Aguilera&#39;s &quot;Genie In a Bottle&quot; was one of my favorites.

Man I just recently realized the lyrics to Real Slim Shady is ‚ÄúThese kids eat up these albums like they are Valium.‚Äù and not ‚ÄúThese kids eat up these albums like they are values.‚Äù

As a kid, I only eat great value valium.

I still hold that the radio edit line &quot;I just drank a fifth of kool-aid, dare me to drive?&quot; from &quot;My Name Is&quot; is actually how the song should be because it&#39;s just funnier.

My favorite song in second grade was The Bad Touch because it was about animals on the discovery channel. As an adult, I still love the song but a little horrified by thoughts of my younger self singing that ALL THE TIME. 

Hahahaha omg thanks to you this will now be stuck in my head all god damn night :P

My mom said she was mortified when my older sister started singing ‚ÄúLike a Virgin‚Äù during one of my moms craft boutiques. My little sister was singing the ‚ÄúWhips and Chains‚Äù song by Rhianna for a bit too. I was into Marilyn Manson so my mother basically never got a break. 

This thread has reminded me of a situation where kids were not singing the lyrics, but the music made the experience surreal.
About 4 years ago, my wife and I took our son to a birthday party at one of those bounce house activity centers. We had never been to this particular one, but we frequented another one near our house that was very clean, well-lit, and safe.
We open the door and walk into a hybrid dance club/strip joint vibe. Dark walls, low lights, loud music, colored strobes... once your child ran into one of the bounce houses, you were blind until they hopefully emerged a few minutes later. My boy, excited beyond reasoning, ran for one of the slides. My wife and a I took up positions that would allow us to see as much as possible, and gave each other the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here for 20 minutes or the first incident‚Äù look.
While I‚Äôm watching my child amid the dozens of toddlers and children play, I start to hear the music booming out of the speakers. It‚Äôs S&amp;M by Rihanna. ‚ÄúSex in the air, I don‚Äôt care, I love the smell of it‚Äù.... I catch myself in one of those moments of semi-disassociation, watching a group of little girls run by me as the purple spotlights trace the walls and Rihanna sings about kinky sex. I snap out of it a second later, hearing ‚Äúwhips and chains excite me‚Äù. I look at my wife, already staring at me, and say ‚Äúwhere the fuck are we?‚Äù. We collect our boy and leave. 
Tl;dr: Rihanna‚Äôs S&amp;M probably shouldn‚Äôt be played within 100 yards of a bounce house.

So bizarre, who the hell plays that at a kids event? Jesus...

I have a two year old. You haven‚Äôt seen adorable until you see him bobbing his head and trying to sing ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a fuck I don‚Äôt give a fuck what‚Äô followed by a ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt fuck with you‚Äô. I may be either the worst or the best mom ever, we‚Äôll see at the talent show.

You are already the best on my book. 

My nephew was singing Hot In Herre by Nelly yesterday

I&#39;m sure he&#39;s just kidding

Like Jason

Unless you&#39;re gonna do it. 

&quot;I&#39;m horny, horny, horny, hornySo horny, I&#39;m horny, horny, horny I&#39;m horny, horny, horny, horny So horny, I&#39;m horny, horny, horny tonight&quot;
Turns out some songs are a lot easier to spot than others. 

My daughter got on my computer and opened a link in discord to the Jesus christ is my n***a song. Well she went around singing that for 3 weeks in public, got alot of weird looks. Son of the original g

Ah, Rappin&#39; for Jesus. A true classic.

I was a School bus monitor for a couple years. One of the most disturbing things I ever saw was a group of 3-5 year olds singing along, and dancing like they knew what it was about, to a song about dry-humping.

I&#39;m a bus monitor! I ride with a bunch of (general education) teenagers before picking up the group of special needs preschoolers. I hate everything about the teenagers except the fact that they don&#39;t cry when I tell them to sit down.
The little kids are so much more enjoyable. Even considering I get hit and kicked on a daily basis.

And here I thought I was bad for my daughter singing Psycho Killer at 2yrs old. I got her into the Beatles, Stones &amp; the Kinks too. 
My youngest is now proclaiming the Chili Peppers are her favorite band. We had to sing Naked in the Rain on the way to daycare last week. 

Eh, that&#39;s simply good parenting. Well done!

‚ÄúDance Dance‚Äù by Fall Out Boy is on one of those Kidz Bop albums, and they sing the lyric ‚ÄúI only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me‚Äù. Yikes

My 6 yo sings Scotty Doesn&#39;t Know at every opportunity. It&#39;s her favorite song. XD

Our friend Scotty really hates that song...

Or, if you&#39;re not a completely rebellious teen, when you try and get your parents into your music. My dad bought Blue October&#39;s Foiled because he liked the one song Hate Me. I copied the whole CD to my laptop and gave the whole thing a listen. After a couple of days I was like, &quot;Here, let&#39;s listen to some of my favorite tracks.&quot; ALL OF A SUDDEN tracks like Drilled a Wire Through My Cheek clicked as &quot;Oh god, this is about something else entirely.&quot; Thankfully my dad is pretty chill and since he bought the CD it wasn&#39;t like he was going to lose his shit. Even got him interested in a couple other songs on the thing. Still remember that awkward car ride listening to the lead singer talk about weird BDSM stuff though.

Could have been far worse.  The End off the following album would have been way worse.

You don‚Äôt realize how embarrassing the music and ideas you enjoy are until you watch and listen to them with your family

At game night one time, we all played our most embarrassing songs we secretly liked. Then I switched it on to my &quot;normal stuff.&quot; Then one guy was like, &quot;ok we can turn it back to good music after this.&quot; 
&quot;this is the good music&quot; 

Those kid pop albums always skirt right up against this.
They&#39;re those albums of pop songs for kids, sung by kids but it&#39;s current music. They change the worst of the lyrics but Anaconda by Nikki Minaj is still weird sung by children.

I was loading my oldest into the car when he was 3 and <em>Hair of the Dog</em> by Nazareth came on.

Son of a bitch!

My younger cousin&#39;s favorite thing to sing in the car was S&amp; M by Rihanna. She said she liked it because it reminded her about what my Aunt had taught her about bullying. My Aunt would glare at me when I laughed in the car as this 8 year sang about BDSM. 

You know that song S.O.B. by Nathaniel Ratelif and the Night Sweats? The one that screams SON OF A BITCH! about 50 times. Well, my 4 year old loves that song. She likes the clapping and humming. 
I‚Äôve got her convinced that it says SUN ON THE BEACH! instead so she will stop trying to scream SON OF A BITCH! when her mom is around. 

This reminds me of when Maeby and Michael sang &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; on Arrested Development.

Reason #6,476 not to have children 

Well when I was a kid, my mom had to have a talk with my kindergarten teacher. I would always sing voodoo by godsmack. She recently told me how embarassing that was to explain it to the teacher. &quot;Does your child know hes singing about shooting up heroine?&quot; She had to say it was my favorite song. A couple days after that I remember her saying &quot;please dont sing that at school.&quot; Lol

I can&#39;t feel my face when I&#39;m with you, but I love it.

My younger brother&#39;s favorite song was ready to fall by rise against for the longest time.  
Its a fine song.

Your brother has good music taste.

Tbh: hes my little brother by 12 years :) he was rocking it to Seether and Rise Against in diapers. I&#39;ll take the compliment ;)  

I wish someone showed me Rise Against when I was in diapers lol

I guess so, I mean I can&#39;t really hear them singing in the back of the van...

I ....I .. love little girls they make me feel so .... Good!<ul><li>Oingo Boingo</li></ul>

Did you really think of this in the shower. Or did you think of it in the car. With a young kid. 

He thought of it in the shower with a young kid 

Found that out after months of listening to the catchy song on the radio by Flo Rida ‚ÄúWhistle‚Äù. Never once thought about the lyrics until one day my kids were singing it. It shouldn‚Äôt have been so catchy. Dang it! 

My 6yo cousins favorite song is &#39;body like a backroad&#39;. Hearing her sing it makes me rethink the lyrics.

My son (when he was 2)  was humming the Thong song around preschool - &quot; Baby move your butt, thighs like what, let me see your thong...&quot;   
Still laughing almost 20 years later!  

Or until you choose them are Karaoke night at an official work function. O_o

Alternatively, you don‚Äôt realize how inappropriate some songs are until you have your parents in the car with you. 
Edit: oops apparently a lot of other people had this same thought before me

It&#39;s still true! Have an upvote anyway. 

I remember when i was 8 years old, i had asked my cousin who was going to a local college and living with us at the time, if she had heard the new &quot;Puddle of Mud&quot; song. She asked me how it went, so i started singing &quot;I like your pants around your feet&quot;...the look of horror on her face said everything.

I used to listen to Eminem and Biggie all the time when my son was young. He would kick his feet and sing and dance. Then I figured I better stop cuz he was getting older. He&#39;s 19 now and he told me the other day one of his first memories was cruising around Las Vegas listening to those songs !! Oops! He still likes them today !!

Try watching a movie with your 60 year old parents

I remember getting super embarrassed watching Mythbusters with my grandmother

I disagree...you know lyrics are bad right away
When the kids repeat them, that‚Äôs called regret üò¢

I remember singing the song Crank That by Soulja Boy all the time when I was younger. Never knew what it meant to &quot;Superman that hoe&quot; or even what a hoe was but I&#39;d sing it regardless

Oh....ok then! Didn‚Äôt know those were the lyrics.
I was in 9th grade when that song came out. Had to go to a pep rally and some of the guys from the soccer (?) team came out and did the dance from the video while singing the song a little. Now I realize that was probably not the right thing to do!

Well Nickelodeon gave an award to and had a live performance of a song about doing cocaine that was so effective, you could not feel your face when you were with it

What song?

The weeknd - Can&#39;t feel my face 

It‚Äôs true, it boggles me hearing ‚Äúshape of you‚Äù playing in my toddler‚Äôs daycare!!

&quot;Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break&quot; hot me when I was around 15. Oh, third eye blind.

I was a holier than thou indie kid in the 90&#39;s and if it was on the radio, it was basically shit  in my eyes, barring a few classics.  Fast forward 20 years and Third Eye Blind comes on while I&#39;m driving and I just let it go because I vaguely recall turning it off thousands of times before.  Turns out it&#39;s about crystal meth, blowjobs.  Learn something new everyday.

Sticks and stones may break my bones but whips and chains exite me

But chains and whips excite me...

<em>Up-town fuck you up</em><br/><em>Uptown fuck you up...</em>

.... you do realize it‚Äôs Uptown Funk, right?

I first heard about this song from a Reddit post by a guy whose kid didn&#39;t know that.

I remember when I was about 12/13, I was driving with my uncle and cousin when Hell Bell by AC/DC came on. We started singing it and my uncle got mad and turned the radio off. It was the Dr Demento Show if I remember correctly lol. He said he never thought of the song as inappropriate...until he heard us. Can you imagine with todays &quot;music&quot;, and I use that wird loosely, with all the sexual innuendos? Lyrics about robbing, raping and killing cops?!

I&#39;m glad you came 

Alternatively, this is the ideal soundtrack for someone&#39;s birthing video. So many extra layers. 

I have an example of a bad soundtrack for a video.
My cousin went to basic training back in July and my aunt was obsessed with looking at pictures they would post of them there. Someone compiled a bunch of pictures into a video and the song was Slipped Away by Avril Lavigne. I heard the song and asked what she was watching and laughed so hard because the song was written about her grandpop dying while she was on tour. Not the kind of song you want connected to kids at basic training like that! 

And I&#39;ll bet none of you realized that Macarena was a hoe.

I nanny and take care of a 4 years old that loves the song Bad Romance by Lady Gaga. Always feel awkward when he is playing and under his breath he sings ‚ÄúI want your horror, I want your disease...‚Äù

AC-DC&#39;s &quot;Giving the Dog A Bone&quot; is off my playlist in the car now.

You don‚Äôt realize how stupid some lyrics are until someone starts singing them.

Did u use a windowless van OP?

I used to sing Butterfly by Crazy Town. My older brother thought it was hilarious. My mom, not so much.

I used to LOVE that song as a kid, and I never thiught about the lyrics... until now. Well shit.

Or alternatively, when you&#39;re the teen and put on your music

I made a CD for my daughter recently and when we&#39;re in the car there&#39;s one song she always skips as soon as it starts. I wondered whether it&#39;s something she&#39;s embarrassed to listen to when I&#39;m around.  Next time, I need to take note of which song it is and look it up.

One of the most humiliating experiences of my adolescence - my dad was taking my car to the shop for me, and I left a mix CD in and on. In that car, if the CD was on when the car was turned off, it resumed where you left it when you started the car again, at the same volume. 
So what comes blaring out of my speakers at max volume? S3RL&#39;s &quot;Line of Blow.&quot;
<em>Get some trick, get some ho, suck that dick, do some blow, eat that pussy, fuck that ho....</em>
That CD mysteriously didn&#39;t come home from the shop. 

As a teen, I never realize how inappropriate song lyrics are until my parents are in the car with me.

This is very true as well.

Same thing with movies. Showed my family my favorite movie Kill Bill, lets just say they asked me if I was psycho and they did have a point lol. 

That‚Äôs a tough one as a parent as well. 
‚ÄúDad can I watch Kill Bill‚Äù 
Son your fourteen I would prefer if you were older.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs supposed to be really good.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes it is that‚Äôs why I said wait til you‚Äôre older and not <em>never watch that steaming pile of crap</em>.‚Äù
Also, he later watches it and then waits awhile after to start talking about how good it was. He understands that <em>I would prefer</em> is code for I‚Äôd watch but I can‚Äôt tell you to.

Or your mother just nearby

<a href="https://youtu.be/GzX04SXfTsg?t=7" rel="nofollow">Yep</a>

Omg! Ariana Grande&#39;s song with the lyrics &#39;wrist icicle dick bicycle&#39;. Do not want to hear my kid singing that! 

True

&quot;My cock is much bigger than yours (my cock can walk right through the door)With a feeling so pure (it&#39;s got you screaming back for more)&quot; Good &#39;ol Cigaro 

You should change &quot;some&quot; to &quot;most&quot;

Years and years ago, my first grader (he&#39;s turning twenty next month) got in trouble at school for singing &quot;Needles&quot; by System of a Down. Oops. 

Bloodhound gang.
&quot;bad touch&quot;
I was like 13(?) and can&#39;t believe my parents never complained.... I was dead set on knowing every. Single. Word.I knew, VAGUELY what it meant.... But, had no idea what I was chiming on about for hours on end........
Until I was in the car with my friend who comes from a very, very, very conservative, very religious family. It was me, her mother, her and her younger (by only a year or so) brother....
The song came on the radio.. We begged her mom to leave it in despite her mother&#39;s visible shrinkage in the driver&#39;s seat.... Once the song was over, and I was done showing-off... (or so I thought)I swear to God her brother yelled....
HEY, MOM, WHAT&#39;S HORNY MEAN?.......
To this day, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been a part of a more awkward car ride....

My kid loves A Little Piece of Heaven by Avenged Sevenfold...... it&#39;s about necrophilia

Awhh skeet skeet motherfucka awhh skeet skeet gadamn

I&#39;m a preschool teacher, and one day I had a kid come up to me who was really excited because she had learned to spell banana.
Turns out she&#39;d just memorized &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; by Gwen Stefani.

Yep, one time, my younger cousin was absentmindedly singing a song that he had heard on the radio. The song was incredibly inappropriate, but my cousin didn&#39;t know what it was actually talking about. My aunt mumbled &quot;I am so glad he doesn&#39;t know what that actually means,&quot; under her breath.
Also, you don&#39;t realize how inappropriate some songs you used to like when you were a kid are, until you hear them again when you get older. 

My 1 year old daughter is currently obsessed with beautiful trauma. Im scared as to when she can understand and repeat the lyrics.

I know! I was just saying how bad the new JT song is (yes it‚Äôs called filthy I didn‚Äôt expect it to be clean) and he‚Äôs performing at the super bowl. Kids are exposed to sex non stop from every outlet and we wonder why there‚Äôs little thots running around in middle school. 

Me and my friends call The Weekends music &quot;pussy juice&quot; music cause of how often he mentions it. Yet none of the women seem to actively notice it

Nope it&#39;s pretty obvious that &quot;Custer&quot; is inappropriate honestly all of Slipknot&#39;s songs really.

Yeah, my son said &quot;donkey jizz&quot; last night.  Shit.

My son loves singing Smack My Bitch up. Usually after his mum has just nailed a bottle of vodka, had a fight with a DJ and come home to a dirty kitchen and finds me on reddit.

Deeply underrated comment.

Me &amp; my nephew singing in my car: &quot;Cruisin&#39; down the street in my 6-4. Jockin&#39; the bitches, slappin&#39; da hos.&quot;

Or your dad is sitting there with you. 

I usually realize when I try to sing along...oh wait 

While Inappropriate, seeing a young kid repeat it can often be quite funny at the same time. 

I‚Äôm aging myself but....I vividly recall my best friends parents laughing hysterically while we rocked out to Grease Lightening, lol.We were about 9, had no idea.

Truth

I say this just about everyday of my life...  

I&#39;ve always known but if I ever mentioned it I would be mocked, ostracized and treated like an old man.

Heard a 5 year old singing &quot;Look at Me&quot; by XXXTentacion while playing GTA V on PlayStation.

I met one of my kids friends in kindergarten and she wanted to sing lady gagas &quot;poker face&quot; for me. 

My parents used to let me sing work it by missy Elliot when I was younger...

Family friendly pg clean

This is also so true for when you play music in a classroom, then hear endless amounts of giggling.

Or playing it with your parents 

Sounds more like a car thought to me.

Oh yeah,  our 17yo &amp; 19yo taught our 8yo ‚ÄúI‚Äôm horny, I‚Äôm horny horny horny ‚Äú  

I teach music at an elementary school, K-5. I try my best to search out songs they like that are appropriate, but every time they start singing along with one I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh fuck.. I hope they don‚Äôt say fuck.‚Äù

Every single R&amp;B/Hip Hop song I used to listen to and sing/rap growing up in the 90s.

The thing is, neither do they.

Just parent things 

Reddit notification squad checking in.

Lol

&quot;UPTOWN FUNK!!!&quot;
Yes honey, &quot;Uptown fuNk&quot; Be sure to enunciate that &quot;N&quot;!

Used to sing Shattered by The Rolling Stones. I was 7 and my 14 year old sister would get super embarrassed when I sang &quot;and sex and sex and sex and look at Me!&quot;

Whoop, there it is!

I had an MC hammer&#39;s album. I remember my mom cringing and skipping forward every time Soft and Wet came on. Many years later I understood why.

Did you learn from experience?

Or your preschooler walking through the store singing, &quot;forget about your girlfriend and meet me in the hotel room&quot;

<em>my sex is on fiiiiyyyuuurrrrr</em> blaring from the back seat.

&quot;Daddy, what does *&amp;!@ mean?&quot;

Yeah and they sing the entire song except the one cuss word in the sentence

Or an adult with the brain of a young kid

I got that Rollie Rollie Rollie with a dab a ranch

Unless you&#39;re like my mother and now all of your adult children still remember the the lyrics to Nobody by Keith Sweat.

That&#39;s because they&#39;re only inappropriate if there&#39;s a kid in your car.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna fuck some hoes after I rock this place!&quot; Whoops!

That&#39;s how the Parental Advisory stickers started.  Tipper Gore walked in on her kids singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA_FqxZLSMk" rel="nofollow">&quot;Darling Nikki&quot;</a>, and made it a whole big thing.

this was my ‚Äúgrandma‚Äù (20 years my grandfathers junior) with five cousins in the car singing ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù before she realized she should change the station

It&#39;s not an inappropriate song until someone inappropriate sings it.

My brothers used to play Easy E for me and my little bro when we were about 9 or 10. Bad influences.  I turned out okay.

My ween cofts more than yo went

When i was a young kid, i couldnt even understand what singers were saying most of the time, so i wouldn&#39;t be able to repeat them anyways lol.

ThAts‚Äô w‚Äôhy im not a‚Äôn English maj‚Äôor

I can‚Äôt stand that ‚Äúlove me like you do, touch me like you do‚Äù song after watching a 10-12 year old sing it repeatedly at a hotel I was staying at. 

I learned this a few years back as my then 7-year-old granddaughter was singing Brittany Spears song &quot;not so innocent&quot; in the back seat of my car....yikes

English is not my main language, neither is for my familyAbout one month ago, my 10 years old brother, my mother and I went for a trip, about 3 hours of car that became 5 because my mother like to ignore me and my gpsDuring the trip we had one CD that we played in loop, No Grave but the Sea from Alestorm.It&#39;s really fun to heard a 10 years old trying to sing &quot;Fucked with an Anchor&quot;

I teach pop and rock music to children ages 4-11. Some pop music is so filthy, shame really considering the majority of their target audience is under 15....Little Mix especially, so filthy... 

My 9 year old shouts &quot;BEEP&quot; to cover the bad words when her sister is in the car. (Who is 1.5 years her junior).

This seems more like /carthoughts.

Sir Mix A lot - Baby Got Back.
My 5 and 9 y/o sing it all the time. It was in a kids movie their nana took them to go see so they don‚Äôt believe me when I say it is inappropriate. The ‚Äòget sprung‚Äô line kills me every time. 

I had a new car and didn&#39;t realize my CD player started as I started my car. I had a System of Down CD in. Took my four year old brother somewhere, Violent Pornography starts blasting out of the speakers, and I got to explain to my mom why her preschooler was asking what pornography was.
I was pretty much only allowed to play Nirvana and country around by baby brothers, on the assumption the latter didn&#39;t have any curse words, and they couldn&#39;t understand any in the former.

I got really into Smash Mouth as a kid because of Shrek, and they have a song called &quot;Stoned&quot; that I thought was about biblical stoning, like &quot;I&#39;m getting stoned&quot; literally meant &quot;I&#39;m getting rocks thrown at me&quot;. So na√Øve.

I get those goosebumps every time....

Yeah my six and nine year olds love uptown funk just on the single reason that when you say it, it&#39;s as close as they can get to saying fuck without repercussions. 
And let&#39;s not forget about &#39;Sex with me so amazinnnnnnnn&#39; kids hearing that and singing it from the radio in broad daylight. Thank you Rihanna for making me have to somewhat have &quot;The talk&quot; with them wayyyyyyy too early....  Sigh I hate this generation. -_-

to be fair, I a 26 year old guy once had an in-depth conversation with my mom trying to convince her that the line in the Uptown Funk actually did say &quot;I make a dragon want a retirement&quot; so that means that music can still be silly and fun without being dirty and inappropriate. 

Hey fair enough I know it&#39;s not dirty, just gotta love the little smirks these kids get on their faces thinking they are being bad lmao 

Or they repeat at the wrong time, like when you run into  your boss and his kids at a McDs

May be connected to the fact &quot;inappropriate&quot; is context related and subjective.
The song is not inappropriate untill you hear the young kid repeating it.

How was I suppose to realise before hand that a rap song that said &quot;Young pussy smack da lips, red hot in Gucci pants. Fuck my cunt &#39;with yo big diiiick!&quot; would be inappropriate?
*I just reread it and it sounds like a typical Nicki Minaj song

&quot;Don&#39;t want to meet your daddy, Hey ya! Uh -oh. Just want you in my Caddy, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh- oh. Don&#39;t want to meet your mama, Hey ya! Uh-oh. Just want to make you cumma, Uh-oh, Hey ya!&quot;
Yea... Hearing your granddaughter who&#39;s 11 sing this... Didn&#39;t even want to ask her if she knew what it meant! 

So true

When I was 6 we went to Disney land and saw a puppet show of some kind, and the guy running the puppet show asked the audience what their favorite song was and he called on me and I asked him to sing American Pie by Don McLean. It was my favorite song and I didn‚Äôt understand why he ignored me and proceeded to sing twinkle twinkle little star instead. 
Turns out he didn‚Äôt want to sing all 8 minutes of a song meant for adults to a crowd of 8-3 year olds. 

We had to bring in our favorite song and lyrics when I was in 6th grade. My favorite song was ‚ÄúBaby Got Back.‚Äù I brought in a cd and printed lyrics, handed it to the music teacher, and she took one look at me, horrified, and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can play this...‚Äù It went right over my head and I didn‚Äôt even feel embarrassed. So I settled for my second favorite song ‚ÄúBrandy‚Äù. 

Play Bassnectar for your kids.. duh fam

It was pretty jarring to hear &quot;In your snatch fits pleasure, a broom- shaped pleasure!&quot; in an iPhone commercial. I assume they didn&#39;t know what was being said.

My youngest was about 6 yo when I heard him in his room quietly singing to himself. ‚ÄúCut my life into pieces...‚Äù

Third eye blind - semi-charmed life.
&quot;She&#39;s got her own motivation¬†She comes round and she goes down on me¬†And I make her smile¬†It&#39;s like a drug for you¬†Do ever what you want to do¬†Coming over you&quot;

Listening to your seven year old niece sing Polkadot Cadaver&#39;s - Chloroform Girl is disturbing to say the least...

True story. My 4-year-old loves 80&#39;s music. After hearing the Styx &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;, she ran into her pre-school chanting &quot;Kill Roy! Kill Roy!&quot;

As a 10 year old, I thought FACK by Eminem was just a funny song and there was farting and hamsters!!

‚ÄúLets have some fun this beat is sick. I wanna take a ride on your disco stick‚Äù how is that even allowed on the radio? Sick fucks got my little sister and brother singing in unison about grinding someone‚Äôs penis... not ok.

My mom&#39;s not great at english so she doesn&#39;t catch a lot of the &quot;subtleties&quot; of the songs she likes the most, and even worse, she always gets grossed out if anything I listen to is sexual or smth hahaha

10 years old singing Creep by TLC...

I used to belt out &quot;One More Minute&quot; by Weird Al Yankovick. It wasn&#39;t until I was an older teen singing the song did I understand the line &quot;I&#39;m stranded all alone in the gas station of live, and I have to use the self service pump&quot;
I called my mom and asked why she let me sing that all the time.  She said &quot;you didn&#39;t know what it meant&quot;.  No, mom, but you did.

Why are you showering with kids?

I was at a housing project with a church group putting on a halloween party for the kids. I&#39;d given a child, probably in kindergarten, a sucker and he started singing &quot;lick it like a loli-pop.&quot; I&#39;m standing there shocked and he&#39;s like &quot;what, it&#39;s a song?&quot; 

You don&#39;t get me high anymore

I‚Äôm 24 and my mom still makes comments when she hears just curse words from my music in my car. Nothing very bad, mostly just catches her off guard (I don‚Äôt curse or rarely do and never certain words, just the ones that technically have normal meanings, bitch, hell, damn...I get pretty bad when playing Overwatch though...lots of bitches!).
Woman by Kesha really got a rise out of her when we drove 180 miles each way back in October. She didn‚Äôt like that song at all!

I&#39;ve found a value to convert:<ul><li>180.0mi is equal to 289.68km or 1520629.92 bananas</li></ul>

The favorite song of my nieces, 3 and 6, goes like ‚Äú I didnt know that I was starving til I TASTED YOUUUU ‚Äú I can‚Äôt help but cringe especially when they shout the I TASTED YOU part

I remember being like 5 or 6 years old in the early/mid 80s, sitting in the back seat of my parents&#39; car on a trip to the mall, and singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;... specifically: <em>Like a virgin, touched for the very first time</em>
No one said anything, even though I&#39;m pretty sure everyone was aware of the awkwardness.

My 6-year-old cousin says that her favorite band is Weezer. She will scream out the lyrics of ‚Äútired of sex‚Äù until her mom makes her stop.

Umm yeah I gotta stop listening to rap music around my 3yo

You don&#39;t realize how inappropriate some lyrics are until your parents are in the car with you.

or until you are listening with your parents in the car

When I was a kid I used to sing &quot;It Wasn&#39;t Me&quot; by ShaggyOh how surprised I was to find out the real meaning LOL

&quot;That&#39;s why I fucked yo bitch you fat mother fucker&quot; - 2pac

Or your parents sitting next to you.

Pretty sure I realized how inappropriate some song lyrics were when I was a kid myself, hearing adults play them. Unfortunately it&#39;s gotten even worse, cause it&#39;s so easy to access whatever music you want nowadays.

You were once the young kid in the car and didn&#39;t realize so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it

Hear that. Was happy the kids would sing along in the car until in the middle of dinner one shouts out ‚Äòshot through the heart and you‚Äôre to blame, you give love a bad name.‚Äô Mostly intelligibly. Over and over and over. 

Or when your the little kid and your parents are in the car

My kids (older now) <em>loved</em> Hey Ya by OutKast and knew all the words. It was mostly ok except for the part about:
‚ÄúDon&#39;t want to meet your mamaJust want to make you come uh‚Äù
which I always tried to talk through, but they would YELL at the top of their lungs.
I found out recently that my daughter thought he was saying ‚Äúcomma‚Äù and assumed he was helping her with homework.
