Take me to the Candy Shop~
I&#39;ll let you lick the lollipop~


Frugal_Wife     Sat Feb 3 22:52:46 2018 UTC

I used to be a nanny for a kid who would sing his own version of this. &quot;Take me to the Candy Shop, I&#39;ll let you lick my pork chop.&quot; 


that_one_bunny     Sat Feb 3 23:37:52 2018 UTC

At least he kept the message the same


Frugal_Wife     Sun Feb 4 00:00:43 2018 UTC

It also still rhymed. So he was able to respect the poetry of the song. 


tacojohn48     Sun Feb 4 03:33:48 2018 UTC

I was at a housing project with a church group putting on a halloween party for the kids. I&#39;d given a child, probably in kindergarten, a sucker and he started singing &quot;lick it like a loli-pop.&quot; I&#39;m standing there shocked and he&#39;s like &quot;what, it&#39;s a song?&quot;


wasteoffire     Sun Feb 4 09:49:45 2018 UTC

I used to sing this is fifth grade. For some reason I always put a Jamaican accent on it and turned it into a reggae song


yancymcfly     Sun Feb 4 11:11:33 2018 UTC

I was the little kid sing this to my stepmom. I had no idea, I imagine she did.

The lyrics of Get Low by Lil Jon &amp; The Eastside Boyz always gave me a chuckle, especially when they played the censored version for a Middle School function. Thankfully, I had the internet and had heard the original, so imagine how hilarious it was to see all these idiots chiming in on the chorus. <em>facepalm</em>

One of my violent femmes albums starts off with an intro that says ‚Äúyou can not fuck with this band.‚Äù When my youngest was 2 or so she wanted to listen to the violent femmes and shouted ‚Äúi want to fuck this band!‚Äù 
Her father forbid me from listening to that band with her in the car after that.

Five years ago, age 33, hanging out with a friend of mine, I don‚Äôt know, smoking weed probably, and he randomly broke news that he bought 2 tickets to see Lil Wane (AKA ‚ÄúYoung Weezey,‚Äù former front man/founder of the dirty South Hip-Hop super group...Hot Boys) anyway, live at the Key Arena, sold out show. Will I go? Sure. Why not?Well, because I didn‚Äôt know that ‚ÄúWeezey‚Äôs‚Äù core fan base was millions of middle-class suburban white people, mostly tweens, and their parents. 3:1 ratio. There was no beer, and not enough weed.

Years later you realize it is NOT to be sang by children.


ChasingMeDown     Sun Feb 4 04:35:46 2018 UTC

This song was rampant in my school when I was in third grade. We understood what we were singing considerably better than the adults seemed to realize.

Anyone explain?


hotaru251     Sun Feb 4 10:26:57 2018 UTC

Basically the Barbie girl song is &quot;adult.
Some of lyrics mention her saying she&#39;s your doll and can touch and undress her.
Also calls herself a blond bimbo mentions hanky panky and more.
Full lyrics are here if you wanna see how not child friendly it is &gt;_&lt;

When I was but a wee lad whenever the song &quot;Get Low&quot; by Lil Jon would play me and my mom would sing it together in the car. She didn&#39;t know the words and I had no idea what <blockquote>
Til the sweat drop down my balls
Til all these bitches crawl
Til all skeet skeet motherfuckers, all skeet skeet god damn!
meant, because I was like 9. Sometimes we would sing this together while pulling up to my school, and we would wonder why we got weird looks from other parents.


Elderlyat30     Sun Feb 4 00:44:51 2018 UTC

Earlier today, my wife and I made our infant dance to this song. We got about halfway through singing this until we realized just how bad it is. He does love his arms moved from the window to the wall, though.

So much of that movie flew above my head when I was young. Then there was a period where every time I watched it, I picked up more and more. Somehow I literally missed Danny <em>grabbing Sandy right on the tit</em> when I was a kid even though it is far from subtle.

My favorite song when I was a child was &quot;Big Balls&quot; by AC/DC. They didn&#39;t tell me it was inappropriate until I sang it to the babysitter. 


Darwins_Dog     Sun Feb 4 00:32:48 2018 UTC

What&#39;s inappropriate about hosting large formal dances?


WonManBand     Sun Feb 4 01:20:45 2018 UTC

For my 21st birthday, I got Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Jazz (by Queen) records. My mom didn&#39;t realize how dirty they both were until I pointed it out


Platypus211     Sun Feb 4 04:10:33 2018 UTC

My 5 year old has been obsessed with that song for the last year or so, I love it. She knows what she can and can&#39;t sing along to (AC/DC and Zeppelin are generally fine, Kiss tends to be a bit more questionable) and it hasn&#39;t been an issue yet. She also LOVES Cherry Pie, by Warrant... I&#39;m not sure I should be letting her sing it, but oh well. She knows not to sing it around her grandmother. It&#39;s better than the Frozen soundtrack on repeat!


----Nomad----     Sun Feb 4 00:32:16 2018 UTC

My 5yo neice sings Genie in a Bottle on a loop whenever we go on a drive! Cringe time begins!

My daughter is two and her favorite record is The Dead Milkmen. I‚Äôm the mean mom that put a stop to that before her tradition of singing Disney songs at Publix turns into ‚ÄúBitchin Camaro‚Äù or ‚ÄúTiny Town‚Äù.

Every day we stray further from God&#39;s light.  
Pretty sure we&#39;ve always been pervs. Read this sonnet by Shakespeare, keeping in mind that in those days, &quot;will&quot; also referred to the author&#39;s name <em>and</em> was slang for both the male and female sex organs:  <blockquote>
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,<br/>And Will to boot, and Will in over-plus;<br/>More than enough am I that vexed thee still,<br/>To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br/>Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<br/>Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br/>Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br/>And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br/>The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br/>And in abundance addeth to his store;<br/>So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will<br/>One will of mine, to make thy large will more.<br/>   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;<br/>   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.

wakeuppmaggie     Sun Feb 4 01:05:24 2018 UTC

One of my brothers (5) kids, a 6 year old girl announced to their entire church that her favorite song was &quot;save a horse ride a cowboy&quot;... And followed it up with a dance while yelling &quot;I&#39;ll ride a cowboy, I love horses&quot;
All of this was unsolicited, during the pastors weekly &quot;greet the congregation&quot; in which he walks around and asks a handful if people how they are doing, if they or a loved one needs prayers.... But, she saw the microphone and went with it.... She&#39;s a firecracker. 
Old ladies were appalled. ..........
....They don&#39;t go to that church anymore. 


JayB435     Sun Feb 4 07:16:30 2018 UTC

Huh. Sounds like a pretty good day all things considered.
Time to go to church and give a little speech, eh? I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love it. And no, I will not reveal what &#39;it&#39; refers to.., for the faint of heart, of course.

McToculus     Sat Feb 3 21:38:32 2018 UTC

There is a collection of lullaby-itized versions of popular songs, called Rockabye Baby. It‚Äôs on Spotify and it‚Äôs like baby versions of The Beatles, P!nk, Iron Maiden, etc. 
Some of them sound good but others don‚Äôt really translate well (like the Muse album sucks imo). Anyway my favorite one to put on for my daughter is the Sublime album. There‚Äôs no words in any of these albums but it still feels wrong to listen to, considering Sublime‚Äôs material is about handjobs, heroin, violence, and other things of that nature XD

axebane     Sun Feb 4 12:06:35 2018 UTC

I remember Madonna had some song called, give it to me&quot; where the music video has her fighting for some luggage or some shit. I spent a long long time before one day I heard the song at a party and realised that she wanted something else.

I work as a nanny for some kids who demand explanations for every line in a song. This has made me very cautious about musical choices, but one of my go-to lullabies is Kokomo by the Beach Boys. The second verse includes the phrase &quot;afternoon delight / cocktails and moonlit nights.&quot; I decided to sing it as &quot;afternoon <em>daylight</em>,&quot; to avoid having to explain that one. 
Unfortunately, I forgot that the next line includes the phrase &quot;tropical contact high.&quot;

WardedDruid     Sat Feb 3 21:41:18 2018 UTC

Last night my wife found out that I let my 8 year old son listen to Peaches by The Presidents Of The United States.   She forbid me from ever letting him listen to it again.
Today in the car, it was the second song that came on the station I had on.<br/>This is pretty much our conversation while listening to it:
Him: I don&#39;t get why mommy won&#39;t let me listen to this song. It&#39;s only about peaches.
Me: I don&#39;t get it either, kiddo.  Nothing wrong with liking peaches.
Him:  Well... I don&#39;t like peaches, bit I like this song.
Me: Me too, it&#39;s a gopd song. 
About a minute later...
Him: This guy must really like peaches.
Me: (trying not to laugh) Yup, I&#39;m sure he does.
Him: But why would he want a million peaches?
Me:  Dunno, kiddo.... I hope you remember this conversation when your older.
Him: What?
Me: Nothing...


reddit_user2010     Sat Feb 3 22:43:12 2018 UTC

The song Peaches isn&#39;t actually sexual though. There is one line that has some innuendo, but outside of that the song is actually talking about the fruit.

motherpluckin-feisty     Sun Feb 4 01:05:13 2018 UTC

, but outside of that the song is actually talking about the fruit.
<em>Peaches come from a can</em>
<em>They were put there by a man</em>
<em>In a factory downtoooooown</em>
Coming from a band whose acronym suggested drug use, I assumed they were just stoned and fascinated by peaches.
I mean, the taste? The texture? Stoners dream fruit right there.


WardedDruid     Sun Feb 4 00:46:21 2018 UTC

That&#39;s awesome, Im gonna use that against my wife mext time she brings it up!


reddit_user2010     Sun Feb 4 00:57:37 2018 UTC

If you want to give her something straight from the horse&#39;s mouth, here&#39;s what Chris Ballew (POTUSOA frontman) said about the origins of the song:<blockquote>
It was written about a girl I had a crush on. I went to her house to tell her and waited all day but she never showed up. She lived in a bright yellow house in a gray industrial part of town, and she had a peach tree in the yard. I sat there all day with peaches falling and rotting and never got to see her.
So it&#39;s actually a fairly innocent song about sitting under a peach tree while crushing on a girl.


reclaimandrevolve     Sat Feb 3 21:46:11 2018 UTC

I came here to post about Peaches too, but my revelation came as I was chaperoning a youth group mission trip....


jasonraze716     Sat Feb 3 22:40:43 2018 UTC

Ive always thought thats what it was about...that he liked Peaches, it was just a weird catchy song. What&#39;s the actual meaning behind the song?


Microscopic_Burrito     Sat Feb 3 22:45:09 2018 UTC

And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature&#39;s candy in my hand or can or a pie
It&#39;s about moving to the country and eating a lot of peaches.


reddit_user2010     Sat Feb 3 23:19:53 2018 UTC

I poked my finger down inside
This is the only line that is even vaguely sexual.
The song was inspired by the author sitting under a peach tree and smashing fallen peaches while waiting for a girl he had a crush on. Applying a sexual message to the song because of one line is just as silly as the people who claim the song is about the beauty of Marxism.


wasteoffire     Sun Feb 4 09:53:22 2018 UTC

Peach is still a common euphemism for vagina though, at least where I&#39;m from


banjo_electric     Sun Feb 4 00:19:41 2018 UTC

The point is that the sexuality of that line makes the rest of the lyrics dirty, which I&#39;m sure is intentional. That and the fact that peach is already used as a euphimism by a lot of people.


reddit_user2010     Sun Feb 4 00:31:20 2018 UTC

The point is that the sexuality of that line makes the rest of the lyrics dirty
That line isn&#39;t even inherently sexual though. Just because one line <em>could</em> be interpreted sexually it doesn&#39;t make the song sexual.<blockquote>
which I&#39;m sure is intentional
It isn&#39;t. The author has explained the origin of the song, and it isn&#39;t sexual.

Man I just recently realized the lyrics to Real Slim Shady is ‚ÄúThese kids eat up these albums like they are Valium.‚Äù and not ‚ÄúThese kids eat up these albums like they are values.‚Äù


skeet_skrrt     Sun Feb 4 00:43:30 2018 UTC

As a kid, I only eat great value valium.


dustyspectacles     Sun Feb 4 09:00:25 2018 UTC

I still hold that the radio edit line &quot;I just drank a fifth of kool-aid, dare me to drive?&quot; from &quot;My Name Is&quot; is actually how the song should be because it&#39;s just funnier.


Sarararara91     Sat Feb 3 23:52:32 2018 UTC

Or until you replay a song you used to love when you were a kid and suddenly realize what it means


TinyPorcelainDoll     Sun Feb 4 02:08:24 2018 UTC

Yes! When I was five, Christina Aguilera&#39;s &quot;Genie In a Bottle&quot; was one of my favorites.


artsytartsy23     Sun Feb 4 00:00:28 2018 UTC

My favorite song in second grade was The Bad Touch because it was about animals on the discovery channel. As an adult, I still love the song but a little horrified by thoughts of my younger self singing that ALL THE TIME.

Hahahaha omg thanks to you this will now be stuck in my head all god damn night :P


DoubleM515     Sat Feb 3 22:52:28 2018 UTC

My mom said she was mortified when my older sister started singing ‚ÄúLike a Virgin‚Äù during one of my moms craft boutiques. My little sister was singing the ‚ÄúWhips and Chains‚Äù song by Rhianna for a bit too. I was into Marilyn Manson so my mother basically never got a break.

alpha-delta-echo     Sun Feb 4 01:05:14 2018 UTC

This thread has reminded me of a situation where kids were not singing the lyrics, but the music made the experience surreal.
About 4 years ago, my wife and I took our son to a birthday party at one of those bounce house activity centers. We had never been to this particular one, but we frequented another one near our house that was very clean, well-lit, and safe.
We open the door and walk into a hybrid dance club/strip joint vibe. Dark walls, low lights, loud music, colored strobes... once your child ran into one of the bounce houses, you were blind until they hopefully emerged a few minutes later. My boy, excited beyond reasoning, ran for one of the slides. My wife and a I took up positions that would allow us to see as much as possible, and gave each other the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here for 20 minutes or the first incident‚Äù look.
While I‚Äôm watching my child amid the dozens of toddlers and children play, I start to hear the music booming out of the speakers. It‚Äôs S&amp;M by Rihanna. ‚ÄúSex in the air, I don‚Äôt care, I love the smell of it‚Äù.... I catch myself in one of those moments of semi-disassociation, watching a group of little girls run by me as the purple spotlights trace the walls and Rihanna sings about kinky sex. I snap out of it a second later, hearing ‚Äúwhips and chains excite me‚Äù. I look at my wife, already staring at me, and say ‚Äúwhere the fuck are we?‚Äù. We collect our boy and leave. 
Tl;dr: Rihanna‚Äôs S&amp;M probably shouldn‚Äôt be played within 100 yards of a bounce house.


K_Click_D     Sun Feb 4 09:43:12 2018 UTC

So bizarre, who the hell plays that at a kids event? Jesus...


Abaddon907     Sat Feb 3 23:37:53 2018 UTC

My daughter got on my computer and opened a link in discord to the Jesus christ is my n***a song. Well she went around singing that for 3 weeks in public, got alot of weird looks. Son of the original g


ThunderMite42     Sun Feb 4 00:59:50 2018 UTC

Ah, Rappin&#39; for Jesus. A true classic.


topaz_b     Sat Feb 3 21:42:32 2018 UTC

I have a two year old. You haven‚Äôt seen adorable until you see him bobbing his head and trying to sing ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a fuck I don‚Äôt give a fuck what‚Äô followed by a ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt fuck with you‚Äô. I may be either the worst or the best mom ever, we‚Äôll see at the talent show.

Turns out some songs are a lot easier to spot than others. 


An0nymos     Sat Feb 3 22:53:56 2018 UTC

I was a School bus monitor for a couple years. One of the most disturbing things I ever saw was a group of 3-5 year olds singing along, and dancing like they knew what it was about, to a song about dry-humping.


worlds-okayest-mum     Sat Feb 3 23:11:12 2018 UTC

I&#39;m a bus monitor! I ride with a bunch of (general education) teenagers before picking up the group of special needs preschoolers. I hate everything about the teenagers except the fact that they don&#39;t cry when I tell them to sit down.
The little kids are so much more enjoyable. Even considering I get hit and kicked on a daily basis.


Gonzostewie     Sat Feb 3 23:22:06 2018 UTC

And here I thought I was bad for my daughter singing Psycho Killer at 2yrs old. I got her into the Beatles, Stones &amp; the Kinks too. 
My youngest is now proclaiming the Chili Peppers are her favorite band. We had to sing Naked in the Rain on the way to daycare last week. 


nwglassgrrl01     Sat Feb 3 23:33:19 2018 UTC

Eh, that&#39;s simply good parenting. Well done!


SoloArcana     Sat Feb 3 23:18:50 2018 UTC

My 6 yo sings Scotty Doesn&#39;t Know at every opportunity. It&#39;s her favorite song. XD


Senseisntsocommon     Sun Feb 4 00:20:38 2018 UTC

Our friend Scotty really hates that song...


SoloArcana     Sun Feb 4 17:17:23 2018 UTC

My husband&#39;s name is Scott, and the song came out when he was divorcing his ex wife for cheating. His co-workers would all sing it until someone pointed out that his first name is Scott (Navy), then they kind of felt bad. It&#39;s his ringtone now. 


bogidyboy     Sun Feb 4 00:00:33 2018 UTC

‚ÄúDance Dance‚Äù by Fall Out Boy is on one of those Kidz Bop albums, and they sing the lyric ‚ÄúI only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me‚Äù. Yikes


blakfayt     Sat Feb 3 23:21:18 2018 UTC

Or, if you&#39;re not a completely rebellious teen, when you try and get your parents into your music. My dad bought Blue October&#39;s Foiled because he liked the one song Hate Me. I copied the whole CD to my laptop and gave the whole thing a listen. After a couple of days I was like, &quot;Here, let&#39;s listen to some of my favorite tracks.&quot; ALL OF A SUDDEN tracks like Drilled a Wire Through My Cheek clicked as &quot;Oh god, this is about something else entirely.&quot; Thankfully my dad is pretty chill and since he bought the CD it wasn&#39;t like he was going to lose his shit. Even got him interested in a couple other songs on the thing. Still remember that awkward car ride listening to the lead singer talk about weird BDSM stuff though.


Senseisntsocommon     Sun Feb 4 00:19:57 2018 UTC

Could have been far worse.  The End off the following album would have been way worse.


Tengam15     Sun Feb 4 00:14:32 2018 UTC

You don‚Äôt realize how embarrassing the music and ideas you enjoy are until you watch and listen to them with your family


Vincisomething     Sun Feb 4 00:24:23 2018 UTC

At game night one time, we all played our most embarrassing songs we secretly liked. Then I switched it on to my &quot;normal stuff.&quot; Then one guy was like, &quot;ok we can turn it back to good music after this.&quot; 
&quot;this is the good music&quot; 


Kindern     Sat Feb 3 23:09:17 2018 UTC

Those kid pop albums always skirt right up against this.
They&#39;re those albums of pop songs for kids, sung by kids but it&#39;s current music. They change the worst of the lyrics but Anaconda by Nikki Minaj is still weird sung by children.


TheEliteSpectre     Sat Feb 3 23:21:37 2018 UTC

I was loading my oldest into the car when he was 3 and <em>Hair of the Dog</em> by Nazareth came on.

Son of a bitch!


LeFrenchToasts     Sat Feb 3 23:42:50 2018 UTC

My younger cousin&#39;s favorite thing to sing in the car was S&amp; M by Rihanna. She said she liked it because it reminded her about what my Aunt had taught her about bullying. My Aunt would glare at me when I laughed in the car as this 8 year sang about BDSM. 


jweic     Sat Feb 3 23:57:25 2018 UTC

You know that song S.O.B. by Nathaniel Ratelif and the Night Sweats? The one that screams SON OF A BITCH! about 50 times. Well, my 4 year old loves that song. She likes the clapping and humming. 
I‚Äôve got her convinced that it says SUN ON THE BEACH! instead so she will stop trying to scream SON OF A BITCH! when her mom is around. 


needsaphone     Sat Feb 3 23:40:34 2018 UTC

This reminds me of when Maeby and Michael sang &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; on Arrested Development.

wycian     Sat Feb 3 23:43:25 2018 UTC

Well when I was a kid, my mom had to have a talk with my kindergarten teacher. I would always sing voodoo by godsmack. She recently told me how embarassing that was to explain it to the teacher. &quot;Does your child know hes singing about shooting up heroine?&quot; She had to say it was my favorite song. A couple days after that I remember her saying &quot;please dont sing that at school.&quot; Lol


kazog     Sun Feb 4 00:06:42 2018 UTC

My younger brother&#39;s favorite song was ready to fall by rise against for the longest time.  
Its a fine song.


Senseisntsocommon     Sun Feb 4 00:24:52 2018 UTC

Your brother has good music taste.


kazog     Sun Feb 4 00:45:37 2018 UTC

Tbh: hes my little brother by 12 years :) he was rocking it to Seether and Rise Against in diapers. I&#39;ll take the compliment ;)

He thought of it in the shower with a young kid 


neisamm1227     Sat Feb 3 21:40:03 2018 UTC

Found that out after months of listening to the catchy song on the radio by Flo Rida ‚ÄúWhistle‚Äù. Never once thought about the lyrics until one day my kids were singing it. It shouldn‚Äôt have been so catchy. Dang it! 


Foliage1     Sun Feb 4 00:06:58 2018 UTC

My 6yo cousins favorite song is &#39;body like a backroad&#39;. Hearing her sing it makes me rethink the lyrics.


MALaggy     Sun Feb 4 00:28:37 2018 UTC

My son (when he was 2)  was humming the Thong song around preschool - &quot; Baby move your butt, thighs like what, let me see your thong...&quot;   
Still laughing almost 20 years later!

I remember when i was 8 years old, i had asked my cousin who was going to a local college and living with us at the time, if she had heard the new &quot;Puddle of Mud&quot; song. She asked me how it went, so i started singing &quot;I like your pants around your feet&quot;...the look of horror on her face said everything.


paingelfake     Sat Feb 3 23:46:49 2018 UTC

You don‚Äôt realize how stupid some lyrics are until someone starts singing them.


dcrsmom     Sat Feb 3 23:50:51 2018 UTC

I used to listen to Eminem and Biggie all the time when my son was young. He would kick his feet and sing and dance. Then I figured I better stop cuz he was getting older. He&#39;s 19 now and he told me the other day one of his first memories was cruising around Las Vegas listening to those songs !! Oops! He still likes them today !!

When the kids repeat them, that‚Äôs called regret üò¢


ReindeerRanier     Sun Feb 4 00:44:41 2018 UTC

I remember singing the song Crank That by Soulja Boy all the time when I was younger. Never knew what it meant to &quot;Superman that hoe&quot; or even what a hoe was but I&#39;d sing it regardless


chris_0909     Sun Feb 4 03:42:21 2018 UTC

Oh....ok then! Didn‚Äôt know those were the lyrics.
I was in 9th grade when that song came out. Had to go to a pep rally and some of the guys from the soccer (?) team came out and did the dance from the video while singing the song a little. Now I realize that was probably not the right thing to do!


jojack17     Sun Feb 4 01:04:53 2018 UTC

Well Nickelodeon gave an award to and had a live performance of a song about doing cocaine that was so effective, you could not feel your face when you were with it

I was a holier than thou indie kid in the 90&#39;s and if it was on the radio, it was basically shit  in my eyes, barring a few classics.  Fast forward 20 years and Third Eye Blind comes on while I&#39;m driving and I just let it go because I vaguely recall turning it off thousands of times before.  Turns out it&#39;s about crystal meth, blowjobs.  Learn something new everyday.

I first heard about this song from a Reddit post by a guy whose kid didn&#39;t know that.


rocco-x     Sat Feb 3 23:31:38 2018 UTC

I remember when I was about 12/13, I was driving with my uncle and cousin when Hell Bell by AC/DC came on. We started singing it and my uncle got mad and turned the radio off. It was the Dr Demento Show if I remember correctly lol. He said he never thought of the song as inappropriate...until he heard us. Can you imagine with todays &quot;music&quot;, and I use that wird loosely, with all the sexual innuendos? Lyrics about robbing, raping and killing cops?!

Alternatively, this is the ideal soundtrack for someone&#39;s birthing video. So many extra layers. 


chris_0909     Sun Feb 4 03:39:11 2018 UTC

I have an example of a bad soundtrack for a video.
My cousin went to basic training back in July and my aunt was obsessed with looking at pictures they would post of them there. Someone compiled a bunch of pictures into a video and the song was Slipped Away by Avril Lavigne. I heard the song and asked what she was watching and laughed so hard because the song was written about her grandpop dying while she was on tour. Not the kind of song you want connected to kids at basic training like that! 


r3setbutton     Sat Feb 3 23:37:47 2018 UTC

I made a CD for my daughter recently and when we&#39;re in the car there&#39;s one song she always skips as soon as it starts. I wondered whether it&#39;s something she&#39;s embarrassed to listen to when I&#39;m around.  Next time, I need to take note of which song it is and look it up.


ParabolicTrajectory     Sun Feb 4 00:22:41 2018 UTC

One of the most humiliating experiences of my adolescence - my dad was taking my car to the shop for me, and I left a mix CD in and on. In that car, if the CD was on when the car was turned off, it resumed where you left it when you started the car again, at the same volume. 
So what comes blaring out of my speakers at max volume? S3RL&#39;s &quot;Line of Blow.&quot;
<em>Get some trick, get some ho, suck that dick, do some blow, eat that pussy, fuck that ho....</em>
That CD mysteriously didn&#39;t come home from the shop. 


spicycheetos1     Sun Feb 4 00:04:47 2018 UTC

As a teen, I never realize how inappropriate song lyrics are until my parents are in the car with me.

That‚Äôs a tough one as a parent as well. 
‚ÄúDad can I watch Kill Bill‚Äù 
Son your fourteen I would prefer if you were older.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs supposed to be really good.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes it is that‚Äôs why I said wait til you‚Äôre older and not <em>never watch that steaming pile of crap</em>.‚Äù
Also, he later watches it and then waits awhile after to start talking about how good it was. He understands that <em>I would prefer</em> is code for I‚Äôd watch but I can‚Äôt tell you to.

Bloodhound gang.
&quot;bad touch&quot;
I was like 13(?) and can&#39;t believe my parents never complained.... I was dead set on knowing every. Single. Word.I knew, VAGUELY what it meant.... But, had no idea what I was chiming on about for hours on end........
Until I was in the car with my friend who comes from a very, very, very conservative, very religious family. It was me, her mother, her and her younger (by only a year or so) brother....
The song came on the radio.. We begged her mom to leave it in despite her mother&#39;s visible shrinkage in the driver&#39;s seat.... Once the song was over, and I was done showing-off... (or so I thought)I swear to God her brother yelled....
HEY, MOM, WHAT&#39;S HORNY MEAN?.......
To this day, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been a part of a more awkward car ride....

Yep, one time, my younger cousin was absentmindedly singing a song that he had heard on the radio. The song was incredibly inappropriate, but my cousin didn&#39;t know what it was actually talking about. My aunt mumbled &quot;I am so glad he doesn&#39;t know what that actually means,&quot; under her breath.
Also, you don&#39;t realize how inappropriate some songs you used to like when you were a kid are, until you hear them again when you get older.

I know! I was just saying how bad the new JT song is (yes it‚Äôs called filthy I didn‚Äôt expect it to be clean) and he‚Äôs performing at the super bowl. Kids are exposed to sex non stop from every outlet and we wonder why there‚Äôs little thots running around in middle school. 


DjAlex420     Sat Feb 3 23:29:47 2018 UTC

Me and my friends call The Weekends music &quot;pussy juice&quot; music cause of how often he mentions it. Yet none of the women seem to actively notice it


LinktheLlama     Sat Feb 3 20:52:57 2018 UTC

Nope it&#39;s pretty obvious that &quot;Custer&quot; is inappropriate honestly all of Slipknot&#39;s songs really.


HabaneroEyedrops     Sat Feb 3 22:50:50 2018 UTC

Yeah, my son said &quot;donkey jizz&quot; last night.  Shit.


CasualSien     Sat Feb 3 22:37:49 2018 UTC

My son loves singing Smack My Bitch up. Usually after his mum has just nailed a bottle of vodka, had a fight with a DJ and come home to a dirty kitchen and finds me on reddit.


dustyspectacles     Sun Feb 4 09:20:49 2018 UTC

Deeply underrated comment.


austinwsmith757     Sat Feb 3 21:47:27 2018 UTC

Or your dad is sitting there with you. 


maxcorrice     Sat Feb 3 21:58:34 2018 UTC

I usually realize when I try to sing along...oh wait 


Tochidaiwa     Sat Feb 3 22:10:42 2018 UTC

While Inappropriate, seeing a young kid repeat it can often be quite funny at the same time. 


K3Elisa     Sun Feb 4 02:59:58 2018 UTC

I‚Äôm aging myself but....I vividly recall my best friends parents laughing hysterically while we rocked out to Grease Lightening, lol.We were about 9, had no idea.

DrBlackJacket     Sat Feb 3 22:59:14 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve always known but if I ever mentioned it I would be mocked, ostracized and treated like an old man.


ThaRudistMonk     Sat Feb 3 23:02:58 2018 UTC

Heard a 5 year old singing &quot;Look at Me&quot; by XXXTentacion while playing GTA V on PlayStation.


cola623     Sat Feb 3 23:13:06 2018 UTC

I met one of my kids friends in kindergarten and she wanted to sing lady gagas &quot;poker face&quot; for me. 


AcydRayne23     Sat Feb 3 23:20:26 2018 UTC

My parents used to let me sing work it by missy Elliot when I was younger...

This is also so true for when you play music in a classroom, then hear endless amounts of giggling.


Bongl0rd     Sat Feb 3 23:28:52 2018 UTC

Or playing it with your parents 


WhenGinMaySteer     Sat Feb 3 23:32:35 2018 UTC

ChocoPopShart     Sat Feb 3 23:36:52 2018 UTC

I teach music at an elementary school, K-5. I try my best to search out songs they like that are appropriate, but every time they start singing along with one I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh fuck.. I hope they don‚Äôt say fuck.‚Äù


OrangeClyde     Sat Feb 3 23:37:49 2018 UTC

Every single R&amp;B/Hip Hop song I used to listen to and sing/rap growing up in the 90s.

TerminatorX24     Sat Feb 3 23:57:50 2018 UTC

Used to sing Shattered by The Rolling Stones. I was 7 and my 14 year old sister would get super embarrassed when I sang &quot;and sex and sex and sex and look at Me!&quot;

Whoop, there it is!


dylht92374     Sun Feb 4 00:00:24 2018 UTC

I had an MC hammer&#39;s album. I remember my mom cringing and skipping forward every time Soft and Wet came on. Many years later I understood why.

Did you learn from experience?


UpYourAli     Sun Feb 4 00:05:26 2018 UTC

Or your preschooler walking through the store singing, &quot;forget about your girlfriend and meet me in the hotel room&quot;


munchingfoo     Sun Feb 4 00:06:03 2018 UTC

<em>my sex is on fiiiiyyyuuurrrrr</em> blaring from the back seat.

djkeithers     Sun Feb 4 00:09:18 2018 UTC

Yeah and they sing the entire song except the one cuss word in the sentence


Joezerony     Sun Feb 4 00:09:38 2018 UTC

Or an adult with the brain of a young kid


Godsshoeshine24     Sun Feb 4 00:09:48 2018 UTC

YahFeckinCoont     Sun Feb 4 00:12:14 2018 UTC

Unless you&#39;re like my mother and now all of your adult children still remember the the lyrics to Nobody by Keith Sweat.


NotQualifiedAtAll     Sun Feb 4 00:13:07 2018 UTC

That&#39;s because they&#39;re only inappropriate if there&#39;s a kid in your car.


chopperbri     Sun Feb 4 00:13:14 2018 UTC

&quot;I&#39;m gonna fuck some hoes after I rock this place!&quot; Whoops!


Dragoon_Pantaloons     Sun Feb 4 00:15:11 2018 UTC

That&#39;s how the Parental Advisory stickers started.  Tipper Gore walked in on her kids singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA_FqxZLSMk" rel="nofollow">&quot;Darling Nikki&quot;</a>, and made it a whole big thing.


thoughtsforgotten     Sun Feb 4 00:16:14 2018 UTC

this was my ‚Äúgrandma‚Äù (20 years my grandfathers junior) with five cousins in the car singing ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù before she realized she should change the station


sebaajhenza     Sun Feb 4 00:23:29 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not an inappropriate song until someone inappropriate sings it.


bdengel     Sun Feb 4 00:25:17 2018 UTC

My brothers used to play Easy E for me and my little bro when we were about 9 or 10. Bad influences.  I turned out okay.

abominationz777     Sun Feb 4 00:31:55 2018 UTC

When i was a young kid, i couldnt even understand what singers were saying most of the time, so i wouldn&#39;t be able to repeat them anyways lol.

stephenmakesart     Sun Feb 4 00:38:05 2018 UTC

I learned this a few years back as my then 7-year-old granddaughter was singing Brittany Spears song &quot;not so innocent&quot; in the back seat of my car....yikes


hiwrik     Sun Feb 4 00:38:33 2018 UTC

English is not my main language, neither is for my familyAbout one month ago, my 10 years old brother, my mother and I went for a trip, about 3 hours of car that became 5 because my mother like to ignore me and my gpsDuring the trip we had one CD that we played in loop, No Grave but the Sea from Alestorm.It&#39;s really fun to heard a 10 years old trying to sing &quot;Fucked with an Anchor&quot;


Monthebiffy57     Sun Feb 4 00:40:15 2018 UTC

I teach pop and rock music to children ages 4-11. Some pop music is so filthy, shame really considering the majority of their target audience is under 15....Little Mix especially, so filthy... 


happydayswasgreat     Sun Feb 4 00:49:03 2018 UTC

My 9 year old shouts &quot;BEEP&quot; to cover the bad words when her sister is in the car. (Who is 1.5 years her junior).


kerve13     Sun Feb 4 00:49:09 2018 UTC

This seems more like /carthoughts.


r_jar     Sun Feb 4 00:51:20 2018 UTC

Sir Mix A lot - Baby Got Back.
My 5 and 9 y/o sing it all the time. It was in a kids movie their nana took them to go see so they don‚Äôt believe me when I say it is inappropriate. The ‚Äòget sprung‚Äô line kills me every time. 


kacihall     Sun Feb 4 00:52:58 2018 UTC

I had a new car and didn&#39;t realize my CD player started as I started my car. I had a System of Down CD in. Took my four year old brother somewhere, Violent Pornography starts blasting out of the speakers, and I got to explain to my mom why her preschooler was asking what pornography was.
I was pretty much only allowed to play Nirvana and country around by baby brothers, on the assumption the latter didn&#39;t have any curse words, and they couldn&#39;t understand any in the former.


Meddle71     Sun Feb 4 00:53:43 2018 UTC

I got really into Smash Mouth as a kid because of Shrek, and they have a song called &quot;Stoned&quot; that I thought was about biblical stoning, like &quot;I&#39;m getting stoned&quot; literally meant &quot;I&#39;m getting rocks thrown at me&quot;. So na√Øve.


PhotonDecay     Sun Feb 4 00:57:11 2018 UTC

I get those goosebumps every time....


cazzyxo     Sun Feb 4 00:58:07 2018 UTC

Yeah my six and nine year olds love uptown funk just on the single reason that when you say it, it&#39;s as close as they can get to saying fuck without repercussions. 
And let&#39;s not forget about &#39;Sex with me so amazinnnnnnnn&#39; kids hearing that and singing it from the radio in broad daylight. Thank you Rihanna for making me have to somewhat have &quot;The talk&quot; with them wayyyyyyy too early....  Sigh I hate this generation. -_-


oncenightvaler     Sun Feb 4 05:17:22 2018 UTC

to be fair, I a 26 year old guy once had an in-depth conversation with my mom trying to convince her that the line in the Uptown Funk actually did say &quot;I make a dragon want a retirement&quot; so that means that music can still be silly and fun without being dirty and inappropriate. 


IAmNoLady     Sun Feb 4 01:09:27 2018 UTC

Or they repeat at the wrong time, like when you run into  your boss and his kids at a McDs


DrBimboo     Sun Feb 4 01:10:08 2018 UTC

May be connected to the fact &quot;inappropriate&quot; is context related and subjective.
The song is not inappropriate untill you hear the young kid repeating it.


Seeking_Psychosis     Sun Feb 4 01:18:12 2018 UTC

How was I suppose to realise before hand that a rap song that said &quot;Young pussy smack da lips, red hot in Gucci pants. Fuck my cunt &#39;with yo big diiiick!&quot; would be inappropriate?
*I just reread it and it sounds like a typical Nicki Minaj song


betchawonder     Sun Feb 4 01:18:42 2018 UTC

&quot;Don&#39;t want to meet your daddy, Hey ya! Uh -oh. Just want you in my Caddy, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh- oh. Don&#39;t want to meet your mama, Hey ya! Uh-oh. Just want to make you cumma, Uh-oh, Hey ya!&quot;
Yea... Hearing your granddaughter who&#39;s 11 sing this... Didn&#39;t even want to ask her if she knew what it meant! 


TheGoldenEagleOfFire     Sun Feb 4 01:28:00 2018 UTC

So true


passi0nsnapping     Sun Feb 4 01:30:03 2018 UTC

When I was 6 we went to Disney land and saw a puppet show of some kind, and the guy running the puppet show asked the audience what their favorite song was and he called on me and I asked him to sing American Pie by Don McLean. It was my favorite song and I didn‚Äôt understand why he ignored me and proceeded to sing twinkle twinkle little star instead. 
Turns out he didn‚Äôt want to sing all 8 minutes of a song meant for adults to a crowd of 8-3 year olds. 


senshimars1776     Sun Feb 4 01:41:57 2018 UTC

We had to bring in our favorite song and lyrics when I was in 6th grade. My favorite song was ‚ÄúBaby Got Back.‚Äù I brought in a cd and printed lyrics, handed it to the music teacher, and she took one look at me, horrified, and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can play this...‚Äù It went right over my head and I didn‚Äôt even feel embarrassed. So I settled for my second favorite song ‚ÄúBrandy‚Äù.

It was pretty jarring to hear &quot;In your snatch fits pleasure, a broom- shaped pleasure!&quot; in an iPhone commercial. I assume they didn&#39;t know what was being said.

‚ÄúLets have some fun this beat is sick. I wanna take a ride on your disco stick‚Äù how is that even allowed on the radio? Sick fucks got my little sister and brother singing in unison about grinding someone‚Äôs penis... not ok.

My mom&#39;s not great at english so she doesn&#39;t catch a lot of the &quot;subtleties&quot; of the songs she likes the most, and even worse, she always gets grossed out if anything I listen to is sexual or smth hahaha

I used to belt out &quot;One More Minute&quot; by Weird Al Yankovick. It wasn&#39;t until I was an older teen singing the song did I understand the line &quot;I&#39;m stranded all alone in the gas station of live, and I have to use the self service pump&quot;
I called my mom and asked why she let me sing that all the time.  She said &quot;you didn&#39;t know what it meant&quot;.  No, mom, but you did.

I was at a housing project with a church group putting on a halloween party for the kids. I&#39;d given a child, probably in kindergarten, a sucker and he started singing &quot;lick it like a loli-pop.&quot; I&#39;m standing there shocked and he&#39;s like &quot;what, it&#39;s a song?&quot;

I‚Äôm 24 and my mom still makes comments when she hears just curse words from my music in my car. Nothing very bad, mostly just catches her off guard (I don‚Äôt curse or rarely do and never certain words, just the ones that technically have normal meanings, bitch, hell, damn...I get pretty bad when playing Overwatch though...lots of bitches!).
Woman by Kesha really got a rise out of her when we drove 180 miles each way back in October. She didn‚Äôt like that song at all!

beigemore     Sun Feb 4 03:46:23 2018 UTC

I remember being like 5 or 6 years old in the early/mid 80s, sitting in the back seat of my parents&#39; car on a trip to the mall, and singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;... specifically: <em>Like a virgin, touched for the very first time</em>
No one said anything, even though I&#39;m pretty sure everyone was aware of the awkwardness.


Battleground11SFM13     Sun Feb 4 03:51:42 2018 UTC

My 6-year-old cousin says that her favorite band is Weezer. She will scream out the lyrics of ‚Äútired of sex‚Äù until her mom makes her stop.
