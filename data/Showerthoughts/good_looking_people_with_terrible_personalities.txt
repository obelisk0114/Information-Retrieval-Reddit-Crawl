Have a date with me and you won&#39;t believe what happens next!

uncontrollable sobbing and awkward texts the day after?

5 Star rating for Tinder.

I&#39;m a 5 star man! 

I have a rescue dog outside.

Because of the women who have ridiculed you for being with such a handsome man. 

Aziz, is that you?

Bad looking guys hate him!

There‚Äôs was actually a wave on tinder saying ‚Äúsend me $5 and see what happens next‚Äù

Is it pain and suffering? I bet it&#39;s pain and suffering!

Nothing?

The 7. Date will shock you!

I believed her when she said she didn‚Äôt like being called crazy. I also believed that she was in fact crazy.

Rape? 

Because of the implication

So you&#39;re saying these girls ARE in danger?

Nope, they&#39;re the danger

I don&#39;t think you can Beetlejuice yourself. It&#39;s when someone says your name and summons you.

I wish there was a program to notify me when someone mentions defiant lemurs on Reddit. So I can beetle juice people.

Post history checks out

My brain can&#39;t handle this

This guy figured a way around the typical Reddit disinterest in lol&#39;s and that&#39;s funny.

When&#39;s the next book coming out?

Dammit you made me check I thought it was a few months out. It&#39;s August 2019 :(

Not the first tho, there was a user a long long time ago with username something like &quot;I_only_say_lol&quot; or something like that and all he did was, well say &#39;lol&#39;. Don&#39;t know what happened to him.

Some say he is no longer lonely, changed his name and is still saying lol to this day.

Lol

So who are your top 10s? Say both dickbaits and clitbaits. (You may choose an unknown person whom you know, just explain why.)

Base 2

What?

In base 2, i.e. binary, 10 means 2. So they finished off the entire list with two entries.

Bootybamboozle

The real joke is always in the comments

What about an ugly guy with an equally as ugly personality? Trying to find my personification...

MySpace.
Bonus if you started out cute, but turned hideous over time.

Poor MySpace, it used to be so popular. Now no one ever wants to come over and play. üòü

I lost interest when my crush told me to leave her alone. Thing about it was, she helped me set up my account, wall paper n all that, so she knew my password.
The way she told me to leave her alone was savage :(
She posted on my public wall &quot;screwedovernight, you&#39;re super weird, leave (crushes name) alone&quot; and changed the password.
So theres a myspace page with that as the last entry

Brutal.

Brutal.

Brutal

man its like your entire account was screwed overnight.

Brutal.

Br√ºtal. 

I have a feeling the MySpace is going to make one hell of a comeback.... invest in myspace coins now folks.

Most people keep their looks if they&#39;re already good looking, they just have to avoid drinking / drugs.

And face eating monkeys.  And diabetes.

An add on a porn website. Looks like shit, really is shit

dark net?

Those sites that sell your email and your phone number to thousands of advertising companies who just spam you with emails and telemarketers. 

Go for an ugly girl with an equally as ugly personality. You got this!

FeelsBadMan

Hey, that&#39;s Reddit!

According to my math teachers negative and negative equals positive so...

pop-ups

That is just being one of the &quot;Nice guys&quot; so ya, good luck with that.

TIL I&#39;m basically a spam email.

So repulsive and worthless?

Annoying and worthless for me. Which is fine, at least I make interesting people look better by comparison.

How the fuck do people come up with names like these.

I thought we had to use our real names on here.

Ok mr weasel

Leave him alone, Mr. Heart!

Oh my god KITTENZ :O how cute

Atomic Kitten is a pop group from the 90s. <em>The more you know</em>.

Real name, checking in

If I could have, I would have upvoted this another 25,000 times, just because your user name made me choke on my spit from laughing so hard....
Source: Have ADD and am a total ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù nerd....

we don&#39;t?

I know, right? Who would ever come up with a name like &quot;hoihe&quot;?

<a href="/u/stillbornfleshlight" rel="nofollow">u/stillbornfleshlight</a>

Ah yes. The story of one plucky factory. Despite missing initial production deadlines, the factory worked hard to make sure another flesh light was still going to be born.  

I don&#39;t know how they do it man. 

Couldn&#39;t describe me more accurately

And stalkers and creeps are like a spam email without &#39;unsubscribe&#39; button.

Kinda like a malware pop up you can&#39;t close?

An overlay autoplay video ad that follows the scroll bar. The absolute worst.

Can you do anything about those besides filtering? 

Spam male

Yup, what are you going to do about it?

Did you just call yourself attractive?

I think he called himself unattractive, since those are usually not even tempting to click on.

Yeah but he has a terrible personality so that explains it 

Self fulfilling prophecy

Or Nigerian Prince !

Good looks may draw you in but a good personality is what makes you stay.

My great aunt used to say, ‚ÄúKissing don‚Äôt last. Good cooking does.‚Äù

Your great aunt cooked meth.

Breaking Bad reboot starring Betty White confirmed.

<em>close up of Betty White&#39; s face</em> I&#39;M THE ONE WHO COOKS<em>zooms out to her making a casserole</em>

Well, her last name was Heisenberg...

What if someone doesn&#39;t have good looks but has an extremely good personality ü§î

Make yourself look good enough. Looks still matter, especially in the beginning.

Then you will do well as long as you dress well, shower, and wear cologne.

Hahaha

then gg

Establish friendship first. Your good personality will wear on them until they&#39;re like &quot;yo id be down with spending the rest of my life with this person&quot;

&quot;...as friends of course.&quot;

I laughed really hard. Damn dude
Edit: meant to say &quot;pretty accurate&quot;

What does &quot;extremely good personality&quot; even mean?

A lot. 

If you&#39;re a man: find some hobbies, hit the gym, be confident.
If you&#39;re a woman: oof, good luck.

Kinda like the desktop version of reddit, you might find it ugly but you can&#39;t get enough of it

I prefer the desktop version. Simple, uncluttered. Stylish design would make it more cluttered. Can&#39;t stand mobile versions of reddit.

The official Reddit app is pretty solid for a sleek and uncluttered design. I think it‚Äôs much prettier of a layout than the desktop site 

I don&#39;t like it. I switched to Slide for Reddit

I use the desktop site in my mobile browser

The only people who hate browsing reddit are those that developed the reddit mobile app.

I use Reddit is Fun. Very simple layout 

Night mode on mobile is the only way I use Reddit. I absolutely can‚Äôt stand using the desktop site 

I don&#39;t like having to click on links for all the gifs and imgurs, I want to see but having to click each individual one gets annoying. Also I like the comment feature how you can quickly move to the next comment thread using the down arrow

I don&#39;t think having an uncluttered design has to be inverse to having a stylish one.

the redesign is coming

Relay on Android 4 life! 

The way i always put it is. Looks matter first but perosnality matters more.

Good looks may draw you in but a <del>good personality is what makes you stay.</del>
clutching, lying, heartless, hollow manipulator makes you stay.

The fact that I&#39;m not into most personalities may be the reason why I never had a relationship for more than 3 months.

[deleted]

Asking their ex is something like <a href="/r/savedyouaclick">r/savedyouaclick</a> then?

Lookbait

Is it too much to ask for someone who looks like they spend hours every day perfecting their appearance, but isn&#39;t vain?

Sounds like a vain question to me.

I think you&#39;re asking in vain.

Yes

nope there&#39;s a ton of people who look good and are talented, internet makes them seem like unicorns 

Theyre <sup>everyday</sup> peooooople

internet works in places that attract gross nerds 

You probably think this song is about you

You&#39;re so vaaaain~

What about good personality persons with below average looking? Will we drive any traffic?

You are pay wall newspapers

TIL: I am a research paper behind a very expensive pay wall.

TIL: I am a buzzfeed article behind a very expensive pay wall.

I am a buzzfeed article
So they spend two minutes with you and then ask, &quot;what the fuck am I doing with my life???&quot; and then leave?

They give me a chance expecting depth then go &quot;wait this isnt what i paid for&quot; then leave
Not paid for literally 

But also paid for literally.

<a href="/r/2meirl4meirl" rel="nofollow">r/2meirl4meirl</a>

We just have to find out if your sources are legit or do they just come from a small, marginalised pool of subjects. 

That&#39;d be like a sub with a handful of active users. Very few can see the value of the content, but those that do are big fans. 

interesting looks count!

I‚Äôm like that weird looking video you click on once in a while but then you watch it and realize you now have a new hobby

Get rich

People who hit on everyone are basically SPAM messages. 

What would the opposite be? A scientific paper? I‚Äôm happy to think of my self as a scientific paper.

Yeah, me too, a lot to say but so boring that nobody pays attention.

I was thinking more of not something you would be attracted too, but can be interesting when you get to it.

Or interesting to the right person!

Yes.

Didn&#39;t they say recently that after the first review, practically no one reads scientific papers. Like 75%+ or 90%+ go unread afterward.

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by that at all. There are tons of low quality journals that are easy to publish in, and that basically never get cited. Some people think just having publications makes them look good, and I guess it probably does in some circles. But really quality science is better than quantity science. 

I‚Äôm more like that one article behind a paywall of a reputable paper that references a legit scientific article, but you won‚Äôt understand the article unless you‚Äôre well acquainted with the subject matter. 
And then <em>mind blown</em> 

That‚Äôs a good way to look at it

oh, so YOU thought of that, did you?

The funny thing about Shower Thoughts is that they are just stupid, routine life observations that are made by any number of human beings every single day. One man&#39;s repost is another man&#39;s &quot;aha!&quot; moment.

<a href="/r/quityourbullshit">/r/quityourbullshit</a>

Where did OP say he thought of it?

Jerking off

Well at least OP capitalized on the attention and soaking in all the karma for himself. 

And I would&#39;ve gotten away with it too, if it weren&#39;t for you meddling kids!

Too bad ad revenue pays better than creating content.

Ugly people with amazing personalities are just really hard to look at

P.s. I am not clickbait. I am an 17 1/2

On a scale from 1 to 10, this poster is a 17 1/2!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" rel="nofollow">Click here to learn how</a>.

You still have a long way to go, buddy. You&#39;ll get better at this over time.

I&#39;m a perfect 5/7. 

You&#39;ll have to settle for being jailbait for the next 6 months.

I&#39;m not click bait then 

I wonder how many people think this applies to them

Clickbait wants you to click and wants your attention though. Conventionally attractive people often don&#39;t, despite what movies and TV would have us believe. This is gross because what you&#39;re basically saying here is, good looking Women are desperate for your attention and so despite #metoo you should keep telling them gross things unsolicited.

Alt-girls - look good, but batshit crazy

All these years, hating clickbait... reporting it... all this time... I WAS the clickbait..

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxRQNO8vg2Y&amp;feature=share" rel="nofollow">Ugly Heart</a> 

More like fuckbait.
I&#39;m showing myself out.

Why do reposts keep getting upvotes?

I did the right thing and got fat. Now I can live in peace without having to worry about women and I get to eat whatever I like. 

I&#39;m halfway there, 175cm 90kg. Though I wouldn&#39;t have to; it&#39;s not like I ever got femal attention in the first place. But food is delicious, and I don&#39;t plan to get old anyway

My family has a history of dementia...nothing much after 65 for me.<br/>I looked fantastic when I surfed...but the trouble I got for it wasn&#39;t even close to being worth it. It was fun...but then it wasn&#39;t. 

I would even have good genes for aging. And I guess I could look fairly good if I&#39;d put in some effort, but that would take, uhh, effort...

Money, lots of money makes you attractive. Being attractive makes it easy to make lots of money.

Yeah Bill Gates is hot af rite?

People who spend a lot of effort on their appearance in general. There&#39;s a reason they do it.

So everyone who puts a good amount of effort into their appearance has a bad personality?

Lol hell yeah my mom said I would never be anything, but I&#39;ve showed her. I&#39;m real life clickbait.

I can confirm, everytime i open my mouth its over

Clickbait at that automatically plays an annoying video at full volume. 

&quot;You won&#39;t BELIEVE what they look like naked&quot;

I can&#39;t wait for this to be reposted in a month!

For a moment I thought this was going to have a happy ending, and Donald got shot and killed.

Well, some people won&#39;t be disappointed because they only care about looks

Don&#39;t worry. When I rise to power, I intend to have those people killed.

Kind people <em>hate</em> them!

Can we start calling them that?

couldn&#39;t agree more

6 things I do while visiting your family...you&#39;ll never believe number 4!

they just get your attention and want somthg in return, you are just cheap in their eyes if you dont deliver.

Meet my wife

Give a moments thought to those of us that are bad looking with bad personalities.

good job stealing this from iFunny

Matebait

Bad looking people with awesome personalities are the personification of Reddit

What about ugly person with good personality? Like me D:

Subjective 

I&#39;m guilty of clickbaiting 

They‚Äôre also called Instagram models 

Yeah, and they drive me up the fucking wall...

‚ÄúSend me $5, see what happens.‚Äù

this really is a problem - getting people to stay after they get passed you looking moderately attractive is impossible when you&#39;re a boring sucky person 

I like the way you think!

looks have nothing to do with bad or good personalitiesits all subjective. Most people are too shallow to take the time to get to know someone anyways,esp if they are not pretty at first glance... 

Women HATE me!

I once had a military superior tell me after a training evaluation, ‚Äúyou know that feeling when you see someone and think to yourself, ‚Äòthis is gonna be an easy day‚Äô ? Today was not one of those days.‚Äù 
I guess I look good but am dumb

I‚Äôm the opposite of clickbait.

Dickbait?

Dickbait if they‚Äôre women

Good looking people with bad personalities are flat out ugly. Looks become void.

Clickbait looks good on the surface level? We may have different definitions of &quot;clickbait&quot;

&quot;Risky click of the day&quot; is like an average looking person with the greatest personality.

Dickbait.

Logan Paul

I don&#39;t agree. There&#39;s no reason why appearance should be an indicator of personality. You would also be saying that bad looking people have terrible personalities by default. 

they would have great personalities but that‚Äôs also not true 

How did you came to the conclusion the they would have great personalities from OP&#39;s statement?

One day you will learn to talk to people, instead of judging them on their looks. 

When is that day?

It&#39;s a struggle. People have to work for it. For those that don&#39;t, that day could be never. 

Guess I&#39;m gonna stay a loner then.

What, do you expect everyone to be good? Have you not read beyond good and evil? A corporate CEO can be a bad person, but could be doing literal good for the world. A starving african child may seem innocent, but there&#39;s hundreds of years of farming laziness that got them here. There&#39;s always a deeper story to people, and it&#39;s usually where you don&#39;t expect it.

I am legitimately pissed off right now. How dare you undermine my beauty to justify upvotes. Like, gag me with a spoon, or a frock or someding. I feel pretty.

Oh so pretty?

Lol. Pretty is subjective

That&#39;s not how the song goes :/

I guess you can say...
She feels pretty, but is not witty nor gay. 

Nothing wrong with being pretty :)

21 posts and no one has had a psycho rant naming all the people they think are hot but psycho? No mentions of Britney nor some other female child star gone nuts? Reddit neckbeards, you disappoint me. 

Your making bad assumptions here stop

Nah cuz you are attracted to them so as long as you fuck am it&#39;s all guucii.

What a strange person you are 

That depends if you want to talk to them or not.

What would the corollary of the pair be, I wonder...What <em>is</em> the personification of ugly folk with great personalities?

People that describe people as having terrible personalities are usually pieces of shit themselves. 

Very true...known a few of these in the past for sure!

Fuck off.

Will you share why you&#39;re so angry? I&#39;m sure reason number 6 will shock us!

Rude

I feel like I might be clickbait lol
