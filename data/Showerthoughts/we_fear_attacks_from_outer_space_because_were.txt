History is our prosecutor.

I would hope they act like me, but I kind of assume they would act like us as a species. “Nice stuff you got there, mine now”

let&#39;s switch the scenario and think about what will happen when mankind sets off to a new habitable planet.The resources for such a mission will only be provided when we reeeally need to find us a new home ( for example when the sun is about to die ).Without this direct threat to all of mankind there just won&#39;t be enough motivation to provide all the time and money and then sit in a spaceship for properbly a few hundret years or more.So when the humans arrive at a new earth they will take it by force if they must because they have been through too much shit and have nowhere to go back to.So unless there is a reason to believe that lifeforms on other planets are acting alot more differently then us, then we should hope to not to be found.

I dunno, the sun&#39;s gonna die in like a REEEAALLy long time. I sure as shit hope humanity goes somewhere else before then

Ok, so that was a bad example, but I think his argument was that humans probably won&#39;t try <del>invading</del> colonizing another planet en masse, until we absolutely have to.  I mean, otherwise we&#39;d just hang out here.

Isn&#39;t it weird that while stars are inanimate objects, we say that they live and die?

Humans master procrastination. 

In Three Body Problem someone in 1960&#39;s China decodes a message from outer space saying basically &quot;Don&#39;t broadcast your planet&#39;s exact location: you&#39;ll get invaded&quot;. She figured the aliens couldn&#39;t be any worse than the Cultural Revolution and replied with Earth&#39;s location&#39;

Great book!  IIRC, she was having a particularly bad day when she got the message so she was like &quot;Fuck it, come do your worst&quot;

This is how planets get named &quot;Bob&quot;

You, Sir, have piqued my interest in this &quot;Three Body Problem&quot;!

It would be far scarier if they were reptilian creatures with the biological intelligence to feed itself by whatever means necessary.
At least if they were like us, they would eventually &#39;free&#39; us after taking all of our land and self worth, feel guilty enough to give us patronizing parts in movies, but leave us undereducated and with very little recourses to better ourselves. Still better than being eaten.

Oooh, that&#39;s a good one. Hope you don&#39;t mind if I take that Idea and use it?

I mean it&#39;s basically the premise of most of the alien movies!

Haven&#39;t seen those. Heard they&#39;re a rip off of &quot;Them!&quot;

reptilian creatures with the biological intelligence to feed itself by whatever means necessary
I just can&#39;t fathom how dinosaurs would ever build spacecraft.

Lol we are aliens.. we jus have to populate different planets then after a very long time they’ll evolve and differ from earth humans

Are you high?

He&#39;s not wrong. Given enough time and separation they could get very different.

We fear attacks from outer space, because we&#39;re afraid the aliens will act like the British.
FTFY

Meh,  the portuguese and spanish were pretty shitty too

Gods, I hope they act like the British! Could you imagine if they acted like Belgians? I&#39;m quite attached to my hands and other extremities!

I can&#39;t tell if y&#39;all are being sarcastic, or actually think this post is deeply intelligent.

I for one, will welcome our new overlords.

There are two scary concepts about the universe. The first is what if there is life out there? The second is what if there isn&#39;t?

You butchered this quote.

Did I? LOL I thought I did well on it.  What&#39;s the actual quote?

&quot;Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.&quot; - Arthur C. Clarke

Ah, the good old XCOM:EU opening quote. I personally favor EW&#39;s though:
&quot;Those who play with the devil&#39;s toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword.&quot; -Buckminster Fuller
When you think about it... far more applicable than when you think.

Actually, the quote is intact.  Just worded differently.  I don&#39;t think that &quot;butchered&quot; is accurate. If I said &#39;There are two scary concepts about the universe. The first is what if there isn&#39;t life here? The second is what if there is life here.&#39;
Good butchering? I think so. Please explain on how you think I butchered Mr. Clarke&#39;s statement.

Why did you reply with two completely different personalities? The first seems unsure and looking for enlightenment, and this one is upset and sound indignant, I&#39;m so confused

My guess? Forgot to log into a fake account.

I hope so

It&#39;d be like the advanced Europeans landing  in America and seeing the technological inferior native Americans all over again. 

Knock knock, it&#39;s the superior race (alien race that is)

Knock knock, it&#39;s the aliens. They have guns, and ships.... Gunships 

And weird goo 

Think I could manage to sell New York City for a death ray or two, some replicators, and a small spaceship? (Even though I have nothing to do with New York City.)

It might not be. They might not have a need for violence. The only reason humans have guns, nukes and other technology is because we  invented them to kill people. Maybe there species wouldn&#39;t have a reason to discover knew more efficient ways to kill each other. 

That is deep

Look at the wisdom in this fucking guy.....

OP is pretty baked right now.

I hope the rational ones are in the spaceship, leave us religious safe with <em>almighty zenthorp</em>

As opposed to psychically attacking us.

I fear attacks from outer space because if they can reach us, they are probably way more advanced than us.  We&#39;re nowhere near being able to visit another planet in another solar system, much less attack one.  Sure, we have the home field advantage, but any spacefaring aliens taking the time to visit us probably sent probes and did their research.  We&#39;re at their mercy so our best bet is to keep quiet until we can better defend ourselves.  And that won&#39;t happen until we stop fighting each other over territory, resources, and philosophical differences.

True. We only know what we’ve become. 

We fear attacks from outer space because we fear the unknown

It is faulty to assume, that just because some Christian imperialist colonists abused the native American populace based on religious and ideological beliefs, that the same would happen today. Society of today would probably take on much more of a passive spectator role, as it has with some tribes in some far off places of the world, knowing of their existence, but never contacting them. At most I could imagine an interventionist strategy in case of the other species posing any kind of danger, such as developing into a unified fascist-like regime. While that is surely just speculation and there is no accounting for what propaganda may do at the time or what stances earth nations would take, I think that this outlook is much more grounded in actual observation of human actions.

You’re so deep I can’t hardly see you anymore!

We fear attacks from outer space?

Jokes on them, now THEY can deal with the machine uprising!

We fear attacks from outer space because we no longer fear the attacks from the terrestrial threats like dragons, sea monsters and other boogeymen.
Humans need an enemy to justify their behaviour.

Does everyone keep forgetting about the fact that we&#39;ve been chasing UFOs that defy the laws of physics for many years. Confirmed by the d.o.d. and let&#39;s face it. If they can defy the laws of physics they can do anything. Literally anything is possible if you can break the laws of nature. If they wanted to wipe us out we would already be dead. That&#39;s what I think. No space fairing civilisation could sustain a war wongerers attitude and be successful in colonisation. They would destroy themselves before they got the chance . Kind of like we are right now. 

I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll be hostile. Not all humans are hostile. Many non-humans are hostile. Hopefully the aliens have resolved any of their violent instincts by the time they visit us.

I&#39;m more afraid they will act exactly like us. 

Im actually more afraid that they will act like us

I’m the most afraid that they will act most like us. 

I’m afraid mostly if they behave like us.

I&#39;m not scared, but what if they behave like us?

It&#39;s hard to write sci-fi about friendly aliens, so we&#39;re influenced by movies of evil aliens.
I&#39;d advice people to read the culture novels to get some new ideas and thoughts on the subject of space and aliens. 

This is just so original, I can&#39;t believe it. My mind is blown. I&#39;ve never heard this before in my life. I&#39;m amazed at this deep and original thought.

Like US* FTFY
/s

Oh, whoops! I must&#39;ve dropped that &#39;/s&#39; way back. It certainly doesn&#39;t belong here.

It does not, my fellow redditor, may I ask what should be the appropriate correction or valid course of action?

No, only nihilists or people with a severely skewed view of humans think such things.

Lol @ severely skewed view of humans

no i doubt they&#39;d act like us cuz they&#39;re not human.otherwise they&#39;d act like us.that makes more sense.:)

I’m pretty sure that any species motivation for exploration isn’t just to find green women, and bang them. 

So why isn&#39;t changing our ways seen as a way to make them change theirs? Or does our history doom us and are they somehow doomed to act like us despite not having had a similar history?

You are either predator or prey. You have to ensure your hunting grounds are secured if you are a predator.
