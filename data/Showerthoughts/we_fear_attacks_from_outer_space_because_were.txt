History is our prosecutor.


TheBraindonkey     Sat Feb 3 21:42:07 2018 UTC

I would hope they act like me, but I kind of assume they would act like us as a species. “Nice stuff you got there, mine now”


kobekramer1     Sun Feb 4 20:05:06 2018 UTC

If they acted like me there is virtually no chance we will ever see them. If we do manage an encounter, they probably wont make eye contact. 


TheBraindonkey     Sun Feb 4 20:40:26 2018 UTC

Lol. Shy exploring aliens. That sounds like anSyFy channel premise


besticandois10bucks     Sun Feb 4 00:51:48 2018 UTC

let&#39;s switch the scenario and think about what will happen when mankind sets off to a new habitable planet.The resources for such a mission will only be provided when we reeeally need to find us a new home ( for example when the sun is about to die ).Without this direct threat to all of mankind there just won&#39;t be enough motivation to provide all the time and money and then sit in a spaceship for properbly a few hundret years or more.So when the humans arrive at a new earth they will take it by force if they must because they have been through too much shit and have nowhere to go back to.So unless there is a reason to believe that lifeforms on other planets are acting alot more differently then us, then we should hope to not to be found.


dfc09     Sun Feb 4 09:34:04 2018 UTC

I dunno, the sun&#39;s gonna die in like a REEEAALLy long time. I sure as shit hope humanity goes somewhere else before then


CocoDaPuf     Sun Feb 4 09:51:19 2018 UTC

Ok, so that was a bad example, but I think his argument was that humans probably won&#39;t try <del>invading</del> colonizing another planet en masse, until we absolutely have to.  I mean, otherwise we&#39;d just hang out here.


Phoenixed     Sun Feb 4 10:12:22 2018 UTC

Isn&#39;t it weird that while stars are inanimate objects, we say that they live and die?

Kind of like how computers die. &quot;Yeah my phone was working just fine yeterday but it wont power on now. Its dead&quot;. It wasn&#39;t alive in the first place so its not &quot;dead&quot; but its referred to as being &quot;dead&quot; because it no longer works ir functions. Same with other inanimate objects like stars.

quick_dudley     Sun Feb 4 03:27:02 2018 UTC

In Three Body Problem someone in 1960&#39;s China decodes a message from outer space saying basically &quot;Don&#39;t broadcast your planet&#39;s exact location: you&#39;ll get invaded&quot;. She figured the aliens couldn&#39;t be any worse than the Cultural Revolution and replied with Earth&#39;s location&#39;


Kalfu73     Sun Feb 4 03:40:17 2018 UTC

Great book!  IIRC, she was having a particularly bad day when she got the message so she was like &quot;Fuck it, come do your worst&quot;


airbear13     Sun Feb 4 06:49:04 2018 UTC

You, Sir, have piqued my interest in this &quot;Three Body Problem&quot;!

uhohuhohuhohuhohuh     Sun Feb 4 05:06:02 2018 UTC

It would be far scarier if they were reptilian creatures with the biological intelligence to feed itself by whatever means necessary.
At least if they were like us, they would eventually &#39;free&#39; us after taking all of our land and self worth, feel guilty enough to give us patronizing parts in movies, but leave us undereducated and with very little recourses to better ourselves. Still better than being eaten.


moonbeast32     Sun Feb 4 05:07:26 2018 UTC

Oooh, that&#39;s a good one. Hope you don&#39;t mind if I take that Idea and use it?


uhohuhohuhohuhohuh     Sun Feb 4 05:09:23 2018 UTC

I mean it&#39;s basically the premise of most of the alien movies!


moonbeast32     Sun Feb 4 05:13:18 2018 UTC

Haven&#39;t seen those. Heard they&#39;re a rip off of &quot;Them!&quot;


PrismRivers     Sun Feb 4 13:25:30 2018 UTC

I just can&#39;t fathom how dinosaurs would ever build spacecraft.


uhohuhohuhohuhohuh     Sun Feb 4 15:38:18 2018 UTC

I&#39;m going based off of the limited sci-fi I&#39;ve seen, but I assume they would attach themselves to one of our spacecraft.


StarChild413     Sun Feb 4 20:41:23 2018 UTC

And they would eventually have that happen to them to parallel what they did to us and so on and so forth


moonbeast32     Sun Feb 4 04:46:16 2018 UTC

I can&#39;t tell if y&#39;all are being sarcastic, or actually think this post is deeply intelligent.


Communist_iguana     Sun Feb 4 00:25:26 2018 UTC

We fear attacks from outer space, because we&#39;re afraid the aliens will act like the British.

Meh,  the portuguese and spanish were pretty shitty too


djsoren19     Sun Feb 4 08:17:46 2018 UTC

Gods, I hope they act like the British! Could you imagine if they acted like Belgians? I&#39;m quite attached to my hands and other extremities!

Lol we are aliens.. we jus have to populate different planets then after a very long time they’ll evolve and differ from earth humans

Biomilk     Sun Feb 4 06:28:33 2018 UTC

He&#39;s not wrong. Given enough time and separation they could get very different.


Horndog2015     Sat Feb 3 22:10:07 2018 UTC

There are two scary concepts about the universe. The first is what if there is life out there? The second is what if there isn&#39;t?


Lcfahrson     Sun Feb 4 00:20:49 2018 UTC

You butchered this quote.


Horndog2015     Sun Feb 4 04:13:51 2018 UTC

Did I? LOL I thought I did well on it.  What&#39;s the actual quote?


simplypeaches     Sun Feb 4 04:26:34 2018 UTC

&quot;Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.&quot; - Arthur C. Clarke


NinjaLayor     Sun Feb 4 08:47:54 2018 UTC

Ah, the good old XCOM:EU opening quote. I personally favor EW&#39;s though:
&quot;Those who play with the devil&#39;s toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword.&quot; -Buckminster Fuller
When you think about it... far more applicable than when you think.


Horndog2015     Sun Feb 4 04:20:36 2018 UTC

Actually, the quote is intact.  Just worded differently.  I don&#39;t think that &quot;butchered&quot; is accurate. If I said &#39;There are two scary concepts about the universe. The first is what if there isn&#39;t life here? The second is what if there is life here.&#39;
Good butchering? I think so. Please explain on how you think I butchered Mr. Clarke&#39;s statement.


TheTallGentleman     Sun Feb 4 05:29:59 2018 UTC

Why did you reply with two completely different personalities? The first seems unsure and looking for enlightenment, and this one is upset and sound indignant, I&#39;m so confused


Biomilk     Sun Feb 4 06:27:39 2018 UTC

My guess? Forgot to log into a fake account.

WalrusGriper     Sun Feb 4 03:11:08 2018 UTC

Knock knock, it&#39;s the aliens. They have guns, and ships.... Gunships 


Hecker_Man     Sun Feb 4 03:13:55 2018 UTC

And weird goo 


WookieGass     Sun Feb 4 07:55:05 2018 UTC

It might not be. They might not have a need for violence. The only reason humans have guns, nukes and other technology is because we  invented them to kill people. Maybe there species wouldn&#39;t have a reason to discover knew more efficient ways to kill each other. 


PotiusMori     Sun Feb 4 15:37:27 2018 UTC

Survival of the fittest is a pretty universal reason to want to get better at killing things


WookieGass     Sun Feb 4 20:30:53 2018 UTC

That doesn&#39;t mean you kill each other. We would do a better job at living if everybody lived in harmony


pauljs75     Sun Feb 4 00:26:42 2018 UTC

Think I could manage to sell New York City for a death ray or two, some replicators, and a small spaceship? (Even though I have nothing to do with New York City.)

Johnnyschuler     Sun Feb 4 05:21:32 2018 UTC

As opposed to psychically attacking us.


Worm_Whompurr     Sun Feb 4 05:48:08 2018 UTC

I fear attacks from outer space because if they can reach us, they are probably way more advanced than us.  We&#39;re nowhere near being able to visit another planet in another solar system, much less attack one.  Sure, we have the home field advantage, but any spacefaring aliens taking the time to visit us probably sent probes and did their research.  We&#39;re at their mercy so our best bet is to keep quiet until we can better defend ourselves.  And that won&#39;t happen until we stop fighting each other over territory, resources, and philosophical differences.


PhantomsGhost     Sun Feb 4 18:59:55 2018 UTC

Well if movies have taught us anything, we just need to expose them to our atmosphere or sunlight.


Worm_Whompurr     Sun Feb 4 23:07:44 2018 UTC

Or door handles (Signs)


TwoGreaterThanFour     Sun Feb 4 07:28:37 2018 UTC

True. We only know what we’ve become. 


sabre_170     Sun Feb 4 07:53:13 2018 UTC

We fear attacks from outer space because we fear the unknown


Draknir1310     Sun Feb 4 08:57:56 2018 UTC

It is faulty to assume, that just because some Christian imperialist colonists abused the native American populace based on religious and ideological beliefs, that the same would happen today. Society of today would probably take on much more of a passive spectator role, as it has with some tribes in some far off places of the world, knowing of their existence, but never contacting them. At most I could imagine an interventionist strategy in case of the other species posing any kind of danger, such as developing into a unified fascist-like regime. While that is surely just speculation and there is no accounting for what propaganda may do at the time or what stances earth nations would take, I think that this outlook is much more grounded in actual observation of human actions.


dannyw19     Sun Feb 4 09:25:13 2018 UTC

SaucyPedanticWretch     Sun Feb 4 09:49:12 2018 UTC

We fear attacks from outer space?


Lenlark     Sun Feb 4 12:20:33 2018 UTC

Does everyone keep forgetting about the fact that we&#39;ve been chasing UFOs that defy the laws of physics for many years. Confirmed by the d.o.d. and let&#39;s face it. If they can defy the laws of physics they can do anything. Literally anything is possible if you can break the laws of nature. If they wanted to wipe us out we would already be dead. That&#39;s what I think. No space fairing civilisation could sustain a war wongerers attitude and be successful in colonisation. They would destroy themselves before they got the chance . Kind of like we are right now. 


WindKanter     Sun Feb 4 13:34:30 2018 UTC

I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll be hostile. Not all humans are hostile. Many non-humans are hostile. Hopefully the aliens have resolved any of their violent instincts by the time they visit us.


Privateer781     Sun Feb 4 20:31:00 2018 UTC

Yes. That&#39;s literally the origin of the &#39;alien invasion&#39; genre; it&#39;s an offshoot of &#39;invasion literature&#39; with more tentacles and fewer Prussians.


alphaduck73     Sat Feb 3 21:02:52 2018 UTC

I&#39;m more afraid they will act exactly like us. 


thirdageofmen     Sat Feb 3 21:31:03 2018 UTC

Im actually more afraid that they will act like us


Muzzy637     Sat Feb 3 23:56:15 2018 UTC

I’m the most afraid that they will act most like us. 


lonelystarbandz     Sun Feb 4 00:37:05 2018 UTC

I’m afraid mostly if they behave like us.


Turtlehurtle112     Sun Feb 4 00:45:07 2018 UTC

I&#39;m not scared, but what if they behave like us?


Utopian_Dreams     Sat Feb 3 23:24:54 2018 UTC

It&#39;s hard to write sci-fi about friendly aliens, so we&#39;re influenced by movies of evil aliens.
I&#39;d advice people to read the culture novels to get some new ideas and thoughts on the subject of space and aliens. 


eaglecream     Sun Feb 4 04:01:17 2018 UTC

This is just so original, I can&#39;t believe it. My mind is blown. I&#39;ve never heard this before in my life. I&#39;m amazed at this deep and original thought.

It does not, my fellow redditor, may I ask what should be the appropriate correction or valid course of action?


Kiaser21     Sun Feb 4 00:41:10 2018 UTC

diggerbanks     Sun Feb 4 11:35:36 2018 UTC

We fear attacks from outer space because we no longer fear the attacks from the terrestrial threats like dragons, sea monsters and other boogeymen.
Humans need an enemy to justify their behaviour.


naassus     Sat Feb 3 22:49:57 2018 UTC

no i doubt they&#39;d act like us cuz they&#39;re not human.otherwise they&#39;d act like us.that makes more sense.:)


Muzzy637     Sat Feb 3 23:57:23 2018 UTC

I’m pretty sure that any species motivation for exploration isn’t just to find green women, and bang them. 


StarChild413     Sun Feb 4 00:15:05 2018 UTC

So why isn&#39;t changing our ways seen as a way to make them change theirs? Or does our history doom us and are they somehow doomed to act like us despite not having had a similar history?


VadersDawg     Sat Feb 3 22:02:14 2018 UTC
