Kids have bedtimes to give parents a couple of hours of fucking peace.

100% this - in both ways it can be taken.

Also peaceful fucking

I always thought it was because mammals needed sleep so they wouldn&#39;t die.

Found the person who doesn&#39;t have kids

When I was little I always wanted to stay up late because I thought it was fun. Now that I have a kid I realize the only reason being up late is fun is because the kid&#39;s asleep.

More like I need some fucking peace of mind, go to sleep!

Try spending one full day with an overtired whiny toddler and then see if you have any thoughts in the shower or simply fall asleep standing up....

Kids get over tired but won&#39;t go to bed unless told to

You know and so they don’t die of sleep deprivation because you can die from that right?


smolfloofyredhead     Sun Feb 4 08:57:38 2018 UTC

They&#39;d still fall asleep on their own unless forced awake, I think.

A child will stay up as late as possible and still wake up excited early in the morning. And be a cranky whiny mess the entire day just to do it all over again. Proof - my four year old.

Not the reason, but it <em>is</em> terrifying when a toddler runs up to you when it’s pitch black in the house.

Trueish

More true for pets than kids, tbh. Tired kids are the devil. Tired pets are lazy and cuddly.
