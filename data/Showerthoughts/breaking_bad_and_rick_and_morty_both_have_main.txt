I can tolerate “Rick and Morty”. I couldn’t stand “Breaking Bad”.

You&#39;ve just got to apply yourself!


tumadre22     Sun Feb 4 23:13:57 2018 UTC

Huh?


goodtimecharliehorse     Sun Feb 4 23:18:07 2018 UTC

You didn&#39;t get very far into the show, did you?


tumadre22     Sun Feb 4 23:19:13 2018 UTC

I watched random episodes here and there and I just couldn’t get into it.  I can’t believe you’re gonna try to shame me simply because I don’t like BB.

Shame you? I apologize if that came off as a shame attempt. You&#39;re absolutely entitled to your opinion. Have a complimentary upvote.
