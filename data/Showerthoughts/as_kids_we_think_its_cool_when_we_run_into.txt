Edit: A lot of you seem to think that I absolutely hate people. That&#39;s not the case. I have a lot of friends and enjoy being around them...in a controlled environment. I have to be prepared for social interaction. So my desire to not see people I know when running errands isn&#39;t cuz I hate people, but simply because I&#39;m not prepared to interact with them. The situation is out of my control, and that&#39;s very stressful for me.

The worst is when you run into someone you know in one aisle, do your obligatory chat, run into them a few aisles down, and have to pretend you don&#39;t see them, or do the &quot;long time no see&quot; bullshit small talk, pretending it&#39;s funny.

Similar to when you say goodbye to someone then start walking together in the same direction. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA_EwcGPBNU">Relevant Mr Show skit</a>

stairs for me

I tell so many people about that skit. So few people recognize the genius in Mr Show 

Seriously underrated. 

It hurt me to watch that

Me too. It&#39;s a real tragedy. It&#39;s neat how it makes you laugh, and sad soon after...evocative.
Well, guess I&#39;ll go to some other part of the internet now, or other personal stuff. It was really nice relating to you with your comment. If I never read your words or see you again, have a nice life. Goodbye.
<em>internet hug</em>

This hurts to read.

Just wink and give the finger-gun.

And whisper a &quot;zoop&quot;

Damn it had this happen today. Saw a cute dog and was talking to the owner than thought we&#39;d go our own ways.. nope up the same steep sidewalk together!

Similar situation a few days ago at my apartment building. Get off the elevator on the same floor as a guy and say goodbye after chatting. I walk off first with my dog, and realize about midway down the hallway we&#39;re going the same way...when I hit my door I awkwardly say &quot;Oh crap, didn&#39;t realize you lived down this far!&quot; and he responds, &quot;yeah I&#39;m all the way at the end&quot; 

When that happens i sometimes walk in the wrong direction on purpose, then I either wait long enough until the other person has walked far enough from me or I take a way that leads me home but is longer and goes trough somewhere else. 

yeah I usually walk to the next paralel street and go that way..

That&#39;s awkward af

Lord help me, this is the bane of my existence

Then you have to awkwardly slowdown to avoid the initial awkwardness

I&#39;m an extrovert and I still can&#39;t get over how awkward this is.

&quot;Are you following me?&quot;  &lt;laughs awkwardly&gt;

That&#39;s my favourite worst aisle joke.

I thought I said aisle see you later. 

Aisle C, you? Later!

I live in a small town and it&#39;s pretty common to run into people you know at the store. When we&#39;re done talking I always end it with &quot;well take care, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see each other a few more times here.&quot; Then every time we run into each other on the next aisle or whatever we just exchange a funny little glance like &quot;told you!&quot; and go about our shopping.

&quot;STOP STALKING ME! <em>pulls out the pepper spray</em> 
This happens atleast 4 times before you leave.

I hope i can remember this line. Thank you for the tip!

Small town truths. Had to go to the grocery store today. Definitely happened. 

I have become very skilled at looking like I‚Äôm too busy to notice anyone around me. Its for their benefit as much as it is for mine. 

The awkward faked smile and nod the second time. Gahhhhhhhh

God I will actually go all the way down to the end and ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù shop (like, not my normal routine through the grocery store)  to avoid seeing them every fucking aisle. My worse fear is someone else doing the same thing and we run into each other on the opposite side of the store. 

Now you have to forward shop in anticipation of their backwards shop.

That‚Äôs why I always say ‚Äúsee you around!‚Äù When I end the conversation just in case I literally do se them around the store again hahaha

No the second time I look at them making sure they know I see them then dont say a word. 

I don&#39;t even bother. I see someone i know, unless they are a GOOD friend, I give them the head nod up and keep moving without saying a word.

My girlfriend thought I was weird for doing this. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to say hi?&quot; &quot;I just did&quot;. Then I had to explain the difference between the upwards nod and the downwards nod.

Uh what is the difference between the upwards and downwards nod? I thought they were interchangeable...

The upwards nod is for people that you are friends with. It&#39;s basically &#39;sup&#39;. The downwards nod is for people you know but aren&#39;t friends with, so teachers, acquaintances, etc. It&#39;s sort of like &quot;carry on&quot;. 
Maybe it&#39;s a regional thing since OP seems to be using it the opposite way. 

I feel like the downwards nod is more respectful like ‚Äúgood day to you‚Äù and then the upwards nod is more like ‚Äúsup bitch‚Äù.  That might just be me though.

Exactly how I use it. 

This is where honesty comes handy, both of you are thinking it so ask each other, how you deal with this? The more you are open with people, the closer you get to them, the more &quot;weird shit&quot; you can do around them with no worries. 

Some of the most awkward moments of my life was after I&#39;d signed someone&#39;s senior yearbook who I didn&#39;t expect to see again, got the relationship tied off all nice and then saw them in the hall like 30 seconds later.

Yep. Did that today. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9pXZIQJHZc" rel="nofollow">Relevant Limmy</a>

I used to handle thay by asking that person which brand of product they prefer, just to keep the conversation going. I don&#39;t do that anymore.

Engaging with them again is always preferable to pretending you didn&#39;t notice them a second time, it&#39;s way less awkward.

Everytime this has happened to me, I just smile and wave, maybe say &quot;hi&quot; as I walk past, and continue without ever stopping. Never had an encounter where this didn&#39;t work.

Just shop with them. Whats wrong with you people.

Don&#39;t forget the &quot;We should do something again!&quot; and then never even text them and be relieved that they also don&#39;t.

i always make sure to tell them to understand that we will see each other again in the grocery store and that it&#39;s not going to be awkward 

Eye contact, smile and nod. Very simple, not stress inducing at all. Just basic human interactions 101

People should try just walking past each other and exchanging polite smiles üòÇ

When I read &quot;chat and run,&quot; the Curb theme started playing in my head immediately.

Lmao i totally get it

That is the real problem 

oh i dont feel obligated. I will do a &quot;hi and run&quot; grab my tomato sauce and i am out of there. 

I totally agree with the OP. When I was a kid(which I still am üòÇ) I got really excited when ran into anyone I knew from school. This dragged all the way to high school. Now I don‚Äôt want to bump into anyone I know from work, colleague or client, or even any member of my own family at a grocery store or a shopping mall. I‚Äôd be in a fkking space if I see one of them. I just want to stay focus on what I‚Äôm getting because I always have plan after those kind of trips. Fukk, I could use some coffee right nowüòÑ

WTF is wrong with you, just say hi or smile.

It‚Äôs the difference between running into friends and running into acquaintances.
Seeing your best friend at the store is a fun little coincidence. Seeing that one guy from your 9th grade math class is painfully uncomfortable.
You both simultaneously made and dropped eye contact, you <em>know</em> they recognized you, but the <strong>only</strong> commonality is the school you attended. Afterwards, you don‚Äôt leave your house for a decade.

Though let me tell you, NOTHING in this world is worse than going to your hometown for a visit and running into your high school ex. That&#39;s some shit that will make you either never leave the house, or never the house without makeup again. 

It&#39;s been 2 years and I still think about running into my ex/dropped friends everytime I leave the house :/ social anxiety sucks

Don&#39;t feel bad. I used to avoid my ex-best friend&#39;s area even though we literally lived 5 blocks away from each other.  Whenever I took the bus home I&#39;d stay on a stop longer even though it meant extending my walk home by another 15 minutes because the stop I SHOULD have gotten off was directly in front of her house.
Hell, I once saw her when I was out with my sister and I literally dropped to the floor and hid behind a car.
Social anxiety ftw. /s

Perhaps now that we&#39;ve got the problem, we can think of a solution..? What we should do in a situation like that so it isn&#39;t uncomfortable

Run 

<a href="https://youtu.be/ODxgfDlWF2w" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/ODxgfDlWF2w</a>

Castrate mankind.

dude. do you know how many times i get: <em>7&#39;s! how are you? i can&#39;t believe it&#39;s you! you haven&#39;t changed a bit!</em> ?   from people i have no clue who they are.  they get offended that i don&#39;t recognize their faces. i&#39;m 54 years old. i&#39;m old. these people don&#39;t look a bit like the last time i saw them in 1981.  so, why do you think i know who you are?

Can&#39;t run into friends if you have none! 

feelsbadman.jpg 

But you can run into people you really, really don&#39;t want to see

I run into myself all the time

When I run, I am still inside me.

Like everyone?

The real LPT is always in the comments!

<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/4p7fJ">Agreed</a>

That&#39;s how you live life..

At what point does that stop being true? Because you&#39;ll see some older guys run into each other and they&#39;ll say something like &quot;Bill! How the hell are ya?&quot; And they seen genuinely excited. 

It&#39;s because &quot;how the hell are you&quot; is directly translated to &quot;WTf?!? You&#39;re still alive and so am I!&quot;

At a certain point in life, you stop caring about the nuance or the awkwardness and just are glad you and your friends are alive. 

<em>I paid that hitman for no fucking reason</em> 

That&#39;s actually what sparked this thought. (Spoiler alert: I wasn&#39;t actually in the shower,) I was at the grocery store and the two people behind me at checkout knew each other and seemed happy to run into each other. And all I could do was stand there thinking to myself, &quot;But why?&quot;

If the friendship was genuinely good, usually instead of dreading seeing them you miss them. I dread seeing my family in the Bronx but seeing my cousin who was practically a brother to me after so many years made me feel like a kid again.  And despite the time he instantly opened up to me. As if no time had passed whatsoever.

I&#39;m 23 and love running in to my friends!
It usually leaves me smiling for a while after the encounter even if it&#39;s just a &quot;hey how&#39;s it going!&quot; 

I&#39;m about your age and it&#39;s the same for me. Sure, you do run into some annoying people ocassionaly, but it really does brighten up your day to randomly run into someone you haven&#39;t seen in a while. For example, the other day at the butcher&#39;s I ran into a teacher I had in high school who I was really close to back then. It was great; the &quot;what the hell are you doing here!&quot; look we both had in our faces for like half a minute was priceless. We got to exchange numbers and arranged to have coffee sometime with her and my sister (who also had her). We both then got to chat with her again, catch up on life and get advice from her on academic stuff.
Anyway, lesson is a) to try to cultivate relationships that&#39;ll turn chance re-encounters into random joyous events b) all that wouldn&#39;t have happened if I bought my beef online or something.

It&#39;s because both men had met at work and what started as a friendly coworker situation blossomed into pure lust and they eventually fell madly in love. Both men were happily married at the time but secretly began seeing each other behind their wives back. Then one day, one of the wives found out and drover herself off a cliff rather than live the lie anymore. The death of his wife destroyed him but the other consoled him during his difficult time. They decided to get married but a job offer that was too good to be true came up and they had to split ways. 15 years went by. During that time both men had gone straight again, got married again, had several children and moved on. They coincidentally both started Thai food cart businesses and were both shopping for basil when they ran into each other at the grocery store you were at.

Hmmm. I don‚Äôt know enough to prove this didn‚Äôt happen.

Reported for not being in the shower

I think as people get older they realize relationships and their past history are important. As a young guy, I catch myself not taking time to live in the now all too often. Met my nephew after he was born yesterday and caught myself checking my email for a job I&#39;m trying to get... I thought wtf am I doing?!

also could be a generational thing, I mean before there was internet and TV was boring AF I imagine people actually went out and socialized to a slightly greater degree

Probably once enough of them have died that you look forward to finding survivors

old people regress to their younger years. They stop giving a shit and have way less to do

When all of your friends die and you have no one else

When you find people who are really good people and you really connect with them. Best friends, I think they&#39;re called.
I wish they were more common but I guess that would make them just normal friends.

I sometimes wear disguises like hats or sunglasses in the hope that if I bump into someone I know they won‚Äôt see me. I don‚Äôt know why I fear meeting people so much because it‚Äôs never that bad when I do 

I know the feeling. I feel naked when I go out without a hat on. And when I see someone first and initiate contact it&#39;s fine. But I have an irrational fear of people recognizing me.

Except you gotta take off your disguise at the bank. Just happened to me yesterday in line. Avoided eye contact, checked over my deposit slip 5 times, and he still waited to walk away from his teller until I walked towards mine so he could go in for the hello and hug.  

Conversely, I wear hats to work and constantly out... So now people know my cover, and it&#39;s blown.  It blows

I hate running into people I know. Even as a kid and now as an adult. 
and watch because of this post, I&#39;ll run into someone I know in the next 24 hours 
Edit: Ran into some people I know at church not even an hour after posting this 

Hey, <a href="/u/mrsuns10">u/mrsuns10</a> ! I haven&#39;t seen you in ages, how&#39;ve you been?

Could be better 

Aw, sorry to hear that. Things have been great for me. Just got a promotion to management. How did that thing we talked about last time go?

Were you fucking the boss? 

thats a really weird thing to say to the heir of a local furniture tycoon.

Oh shit...scram!

What was that thing again? Trying to remember  

Oh yeah I know man it&#39;s been too long!

Oh snap I remember you as the guy I stalked on <a href="/r/nba" rel="nofollow">r/nba</a> with the youtube channel with 29482957 guitar covers

Uh if you don&#39;t want to run into people you know I highly suggest staying away from your church. That is usually filled with people you know. Or do you mean from church? 

Ran into some people you know at church? Would that be similar to someone running into someone they know in the hallway at school?

Last time it happened I was shopping. She never noticed me because I was too shy and tried avoid her. I carted into line to see the cashier and she pulled in behind me. We had a good laugh about chance meetings and how lonely we were and how sometimes the universe forces people to meet each other when they‚Äôre meant to be together. I said goodbye, she kissed my cheek, then I walked away. Talk about awkward conversations.

bruh

bro

I started hating it because the only time it happened is when I was sick or sweaty from work. 

Keep us informed if you run into someone in 24 hour lmao

I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that (seeing someone you know at church)! Lol. I totally get it. Went to church with my parents on Christmas and was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to talk to a bunch of people that I knew from growing up or high school. Ended up sitting in front of a classmate and his parents. Awkwardly said hi, made small talk, then proceeded to be interested in whatever my dad was saying. 

There is a chick that works at the grocery store near my home that I went to high school with.  We graduated together 15 years ago.  I have lived and shopped near this store for 12 years now.  I&#39;m pretty sure we actively avoid each other, I saw her today even and we said nothing.

Give us an update

Just updated my original post 

!RemindMe

Honesty who goes to church in 2018 

When you see someone you know but pretend not to see them even though you&#39;re pretty sure they just did the same thing to you.

I did this to my sister at TJ Maxx yesterday. 

Idk why but this really made me giggle

I wish that would happen to me. I <em>know</em> how to play the game... I see acquaintance- I keep my head down, intently read the bread packaging and without fail, some asshole from work, etc comes walking up all smiley and <em>HEY! HOW ARE YOU? FUNNY SEEING YOU HERE!</em> What the fuck is wrong with people?

Lmao what an ass. 

It sucks when you see someone and you only remember that they were in your high school and and you‚Äôre internally screaming (DON‚ÄôT LOCK EYES WITH HIN DON‚ÄôT LOCK EYES WITH HIM) <em>locks eyes</em> (FUCK)

Posts like this make me think that everyone else is as introverted as me, but then I see people going out of their way to socialize and I don&#39;t know what to think. 

Introverts are more prone to Reddit 

I was about to say that. 

What is it about this site that makes us flock to it 

I&#39;m an introvert and I use social media alot. Now socialize in real life? Depends on the person..If the person doesn&#39;t interest me, is new or I knew him as an ass chances are very low for a conversation starter but it&#39;s a different story online. 

Don&#39;t overthink it. You like comfy social circumstances and you don&#39;t need that big of an amount of social feedback to gather perspective on your life. As someone who goes out of his way to socialize, I function the other way round. I like the vibe of new people, I like seeing new faces and hearing new stories. Our loud culture makes introverts seem like some maladapted people, and those who know better understand that this is not the case. If I werw your colleagues, I would avoid you in a mall although I would be very eager to hear how&#39;s your day going. :) 

i have a story from 8th grade. it was 9:00 pm and it was just me and my dad for the weekend so of course we had to stop by the store to grab ice cream in the way home from wrestling. My dad just hands me some money to go in and grab it(he was on a conference call) I proceed to run into a group of (might I say some not to ugly) girls I have classes with, they were wearing only bath robes. It was hilarious, they seemed super embarrassed/surprised to see someone from school lol. After we talked a minute or two we went on our ways, and I could hear one girl squeal to her friend &quot;you said there was no way anyone who we know would see us&quot; I tried not to laugh as I walked on to get ice cream. All around good day.

As a teacher, the last thing I want to see when out to lunch is one of my students.....they&#39;re almost always friendly and come over to talk but honestly I just want to quietly eat my food and get out....

No, Steve, I don&#39;t want to hear about your kids. I&#39;m tired, I worked all day, and I just want to go home and eat my pretzels.

Happy cake day! I hope you have a wonderful day :) 

I love bumping into people I know and having a chat. Especially as I am supe busy all the time and can&#39;t make it to see everyone. To avoid being a Steve, I always shoot the how are yous first to feel the ground. I hope if we were friends, you&#39;d appreciate that and tell me genuinely how you feel. 

I would think you‚Äôd prefer toast over pretzels

I think it&#39;s more of a culture shift. In certain small-town and regions life is a bit slower and people still enjoy striking up conversations with their friends and even random strangers we see in public. In more modern and fast paced urban environments people just want to get their shit and get home. 

I always feel exposed waiting at the bus stop in my neighborhood. I‚Äôve had this one particular person I‚Äôd rather avoid walk by too many times and there‚Äôs no place to hide so I have to talk to him. 

The older I get, the more accurate this becomes 

If it&#39;s someone I actually liked I&#39;ll probably say hi (if I think they&#39;ll remember me; you can tell if they do or not), but if it&#39;s someone I don&#39;t care to see, then I just ignore, feel no obligation to say hi. I think lot of ppl are like that; you just get this vibe when you get into a situation like that lol

This should be simple for men. If you recognize them but don&#39;t want to talk, you do &quot;the nod.&quot;

Some people take that as a sign to go up and talk to you though. 

Because small talk sucks. It just does. It&#39;s social filler to ease you into whatever actual topic you need to talk about. You need to give your cousin news about your mom getting cancer? Can&#39;t just come right out with it, ask them how their day is first. You&#39;re at work and need to sell someone something? Can&#39;t just say &quot;Did you hear about our deals on life insurance,&quot; gotta introduce yourself first.
Moreover, being in a grocery store sucks. You&#39;re there because you have to be, you want to get whatever shit you need and get back to doing shit you enjoy/are getting paid for. Grocery stores are a place you go because there&#39;s not really a better way to get the things you need to live.
So when you&#39;re at a grocery store, going through the list of things you need and just wanting to get it done, and running into Bill from the office who you really don&#39;t know that well, it&#39;s a huge waste of time. Basically you&#39;re going through small talk at a place you don&#39;t want to be for no real reason other than social obligation. Bill is keeping you from doing whatever else you want/need to do in your day, even if it&#39;s only for a minute.
As a kid, the grocery store sucks, but you don&#39;t have the choice to leave, and small talk... well, it&#39;s unnecessary. Kids kinda just say what they want to say because they don&#39;t have those social obligations to fulfill. 
So you&#39;re stuck there, your parents are the ones who have the choice to leave, and they need to buy a ton of shit because they have you around and they need to feed you. Any distraction from that, especially when you&#39;re a kid and very prone to distractions as it is, is a welcome one. Someone you know is even better, because they&#39;re actually helping you waste time until your parents grab their shit and tell you they&#39;re ready to leave already.

Can&#39;t agree more, since I do my errands on my day off, never shave, live in sweats for the day and my eyes are usually red because I smoked a joint before. Of course those days I almost ALWAYS run into someone. Days when I actually put forth effort and use eye drops? Not a single person...

To anyone who saw me in a grocery store and avoided me, thank you! If I saw you then I probably did the same. And I didn&#39;t want to talk to anyone anyway so it&#39;s all good.

I remember when I was a kid I would give the &quot;sup&quot; nod.

But you know what‚Äôs worse?
Working in a mall or grocery store.
‚ÄúOh what are you doing here?‚Äù
‚ÄúWorking, Debbie. The mall has to have employees.‚Äù

I stopped going to the Home Depot I used to work at because I didn&#39;t want to have to stop and chat with my old co-workers.
Even ten years later some of them are still there.  Unless I really don&#39;t mind having a short chat I&#39;ll go four miles out of my way to another store to pick up six bolts and a couple light bulbs.

No, I&#39;ve tried to avoid interacting with people I know in public for as long as I can remember. Of course this only applies to unscheduled interactions. 

LPT: Don‚Äôt shop where you live or work. 

But other people live in other places.

WOW.  this is so me today.  or everyday really.  but i honestly just came home from the supermarket and thinking to myself &#39;i hope i don&#39;t see anyone&#39; over and over.

As a 25 year old, I&#39;ve been microdosing to help with my depression. I also bus to the farthest grocery store because I like to listen to music alone. So when someone I know sits next to me on the bus, while I&#39;m tripping listening to tunes,  I relate to this on a whole other level

Especially when you are with your Girlfriend instead of your Wife. 

What the fuck is wrong with you 

This is the truest truth I‚Äôve ever seen

Try working at a grocery store. I spend half my day dodging people I went to high school with. 

Relatable. Seen an old coworker at the liquor store today. I went in unnoticed.. came out speed walking to my car when i hear them call my name when i only reply &quot;YO!&quot; with no eye contact and continue walking away to my car to avoid human interaction. Thats normal.. Right?

This is why I moved to a town where no one knows me. 

Not a fan of the stop and chat 

I hated running into people while out... it was always awkward, and I would‚Äôve rather just had a peaceful time with my family. 

The grocery store I go to is frequented by a bunch of people I work with and I fucking hate running into them. The only thing worse is running into the neighbors.

I think it depends on the person. I‚Äôm fairly extroverted, so I enjoy running into people. Living in a big city, it‚Äôs kind of a treat to see people you know among the anonymous crowds. 

I take gifts with me to hand out

As a kid with social anxiety I always have felt like that :‚Äô)

I love the idea of running into someone then it happens and Im anxious to evade the situation

I never wanted to run into friends when I was out by myself as a kid.

Painfully true.

So true, i hate meeting friends now, it feels so AWKWARD :(

Lol I was the exact opposite.  I hated running into friends out and about when I was a kid.  As an adult I actually hope it happens, because with working full time basically year round it&#39;s a good opportunity to catch up with people when you don&#39;t have time to really hang out with them.

Seeing people you know when you are aware that you&#39;re not looking your best. 

I&#39;m so glad you posted this.  It&#39;s beyond true!  I thought I had just become kind of negative, but that&#39;s not the case.  I just like...I dunno having plans to interact with people.  I also suffer from debilitating anxiety.

Especially that one coworker of yours who won&#39;t shut up... Turns a 10 minute grocery run into a 40 minute run!

I‚Äôll be the first one to tell you: ‚ÄúI do actually hate people.‚Äù

It&#39;s neat I like it, I don&#39;t go out with the intentions but if I bump into someone I know I&#39;ll say hi

It&#39;s sad that as children we seek out and revel in any human connection available, but as adults we seem to avoid it at all costs. 
Are we scared of getting hurt or did we just stop caring?

I&#39;ve always hated it.

My aunts and mom always seem to run into people when they‚Äôre grocery shopping, and always when I‚Äôm with them. I usually walk around the entire store like 3 or 4 times waiting on them to stop talking (they can talk for like 30 minutes ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) 

Back in the early 2000s I would have to put on a beanie and shades so that nobody I knew would recognize me when I‚Äôm shopping. 
Thank god for modern internet shopping. I can get all the porn I want from the comfort of my own home!

I had no idea my pleasure at seeing people I like unexpectedly was abnormal...  

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G_CZRMWKPc" rel="nofollow">stop and chat</a>

umm, no, I never wanted to run into another kid outside of school

I saw someone from work on a Saturday at Home Depot.
Unfortunately I hadn&#39;t changed clothes since I saw him last a couple days prior.   I hadn&#39;t combed my hair or taken a shower.  
Luckily he didn&#39;t notice me. I just turned around and walked the other way. 

Me too!

I&#39;m with OP. It&#39;s always awkward.

I am the same, with the exception that I do in fact hate people

I was pulling into a grocery store parking lot and saw a coworker. I avoided parking near them and made sure to avoid going anywhere in their vicinity... Only to run into another coworker in the produce aisle and I had to talk to her and her fucking husband and I was so mad. 

You make adulthood sound terrifying.   How can I avoid this fate?

Learn early on that everyone is the hero of their own story, and unless you&#39;re a main character in it, they probably don&#39;t think twice about you. It sounds depressing, until you realize that it means all those awkward and embarrassing moments that haunt you are long forgotten by others.
Show kindness to others, even if they don&#39;t deserve it, that way if you do have a bad relationship with someone, it&#39;s not your fault. And if you have a good one, any time seeing them is a pleasant one.

Well said. As RuPaul would say ‚Äúwhat other people think about you is none of your business‚Äù 

Nah these people are just introverted as fuck. I enjoy running into friends for the most part. We&#39;re friends. Why would I not like seeing them
Ran into a friend at the store the other day and we ended up grabbing lunch. It was fun 

Don&#39;t know what yall are talking about, I like seeing my friends 

That is so sad

I had no idea so many people hated the world. I love running into people I know.

Just because I don&#39;t want to run into people doesn&#39;t mean I hate the world. I enjoy seeing people I know too, when it&#39;s in a controlled environment. If I know I&#39;m going out with friends, or going to a party, or whatever, then great. But if I&#39;m at the grocery store, seeing you is interrupting my routine and it&#39;s a social exchange I was not prepared for. And that&#39;s a very stressful thing for me.

What happened between being excited to see people as a child and hating it as an adult that made spontaneous social interaction stressful?

A &quot;controlled environment&quot; party sounds like a hoot. 

TIL I&#39;m an adult at the age of 16.

Fortunately, cultivating genuine interest in others is very doable and completely flips this tendency on its head. 

Flashback to 13 year old me. I had a crush on this girl and ran into her and her friends at a movie theater while I was with my parents. I figured I&#39;d go over to say hi but I was definitely not smooth.<blockquote>
Me: Hey [insert name here]!!! What are you doing here?!
Her: Watching a movie...
Her friends: * cringing *
Me: <em>Walks away cringing</em>
My Parents: <em>Also cringing</em>

Uh no we don‚Äôt. Something might be wrong with you emotionally bruh

Speaking with such generalities. It&#39;s like everyone on Reddit has social anxiety. You know this isn&#39;t normal, right?

I live in the perfect sized town where I run into people who I don&#39;t know personally at all, but who I know I&#39;ve seen many times before.

I&#39;ve always hated that. I never stop and talk to people I know on the street.

I&#39;m at the point where sometimes I hope I run into someone I know or able to pretend I didn&#39;t see them, so I can assure myself I still know people outside my family. But it just never happens though... 

I always pretend I‚Äôm talking on the phone when I see someone. 

start twitching instead.

What are you taking about? I&#39;m the latter all the time

I used to work at our local Walmart-like store and I try and avoid EVERY employee or it&#39;s 10 rounds of &#39;omg how <em>are</em> yoou, how&#39;s work?&#39; when I just want to pick up laundry powder.

I would never go back there. Find a new wal mart 

5 minutes walk VS catching a bus to the closest other branch.. For detergent.. Genuinely tough choice

An old classmate just came into my retail job with his hot wife earlier today. I rang them up. Being much chunkier than I was in HS I was praying he wouldn&#39;t recognize me but he did.
He was still cool and all but I was still embarrassed. :(

I live in the same town as a guy I knew in college who I awkwardly fell out of touch with. The other day I walked into the grocery store late at night and he was literally the only other person there, standing in the aisle directly in front of where the entry doors are. As soon as the doors opened he looked over at me before there was time for me to turn around and walk out.

You introvert

I&#39;m 37. There are a few friends that if I ran into them at the store we&#39;d team up and do our shopping together...but other than those few, yeah. It starts to get real awkward around the &quot;our kids are friends but I&#39;m not even sure I know your last name&quot; tier. 

The worst thing ever is when you‚Äôre getting condoms and you run into her parents 

I suspected this was so for many people.  It explains a lot for me.
I only know three types of people: Those that know my name by the good work I do; those I haven&#39;t met yet, but look forward to meeting like a rare gem in the rough; and those who are disturbed by my volatile nature.
The difference seems to be: I&#39;m a very social creature.  I enjoy chatting up strangers, to see what&#39;s good on the market, to hear about what work they do that we can be possibly helpful to one another and our individual causes, to find something new to watch or play, that sort of thing where being open and talkative pays huge dividends over not.
And then there&#39;s the people like what maybe OP is, that scurry around the supermarket like mice, who&#39;ll lock the door when I&#39;m around after dark, who change sides of the street because I&#39;m on it.
I don&#39;t get any gratification over being naturally disturbing to people who aren&#39;t enemies, though.  I apologize without even getting their attention first, like Canadians will apologize to light poles, &quot;Sorry!&quot; for bumping into them.  I don&#39;t mean to.  I don&#39;t want to.  I&#39;m sorry it happens.  
Individual human nature is difficult to change.  But I was anti/asocial like I suspect OP is once.  I change.  You can change.  We can all change, for better or for worse.  
<em>Not</em> or <em>refusing</em> change is the real problem we have.  We&#39;re quite a versatile and adaptable species.  Refusing your species&#39; nature is just as mentally distressing as refusing your human nature.

Oh man! I was walking home from work yesterday and saw an old friend of my Mom. She was doing one of those canvassing for a third party gas/electric company. Asked me if I‚Äôd be interested. 
Like a dumbass I said yes. 
She tells me to say yes to everything they ask me...first sign it was sketch. 
It comes time for me to answer all these questions and it just gets sketchier. Eventually I said no because they wanted to enroll me in a 3 year contract with cancellation fees. They couldn‚Äôt tell me anything more about how it was gonna work. Nope, nope, and another hard nope. 
She ended up calling me  asking what‚Äôs wrong and I told her I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I read the reviews about it online and it was NOTHING but bad reviews. She tried to assure me that it was the competitors writing crappy reviews but it was just weird. 

Haha, try living on a tiny island. I can&#39;t go for a night out or a trip the the store without bumping into people I know. It can be a hit oppressive, but on the whole, it&#39;s really nice. There&#39;s something that really puts a smile on your face about seeing old friends run into o eyes another. 

Nope, that‚Äôs me as a kid too

I&#39;m a teen and I&#39;d rather not run into people from school

Limmy&#39;s show has a nice take on this 
<a href="https://youtu.be/h9pXZIQJHZc" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/h9pXZIQJHZc</a>

The difference is who is buying

I NEVER wanted to see the other kids. 

Apples and oranges.
As a kid, going to the mall is a social outing used mostly for fun.  As an adult, going grocery store is a chore that has to get done.
A more apt comparison as an adult would be like running into a friend at a concert, farmers market, etc, and I think that‚Äôs something most adults enjoy.

Other way around for me

<a href="/r/absolutelynotmeirl" rel="nofollow">/r/absolutelynotmeirl</a>

Exactly, I would rather be like wanna hang (certain place/time) than randomly see them and have to have an interaction I didn&#39;t plan. 

Hi! Imagine seeing you here. So... three pints of ben and jerry&#39;s huh? 

You don&#39;t have to make small talk if you don&#39;t want to. Is your theory that anytime people who know each other meet they have to spend a long time talking, and that both people hate doing so but do it anyways?

Absolutely. I don&#39;t hate people, but I do hate the small talk and that&#39;s what happens at those encounters.

Ha so true. I didn‚Äôt like going to the local grocery store in high school because I was always high as fuck and would run into friends parents everytime 

Nah I hated it when I was a kid even. I very rarely hung out with people outside of the school for the  same reasons as you probably; it just takes a lot of psyching up to face all of that social chaos.

This is not true for everyone, don&#39;t feel weird if it doesn&#39;t apply to you.

Speak for yourself brah. I go to the mall specifically to fun into people I know. Very rarely do I find people boring.

Your edit explain exactly how I feel and I feel like that since way bedore adulthood.

Am I the only person on the internet that enjoys running into old/current/new friends and having a chat? I like to find out how my estranged friends are doing without the artificial lens of facebook

Life is out of your control, man. The sooner you realize this, the easier the rest of your life could be. 

Marry me 

It&#39;s ok to hate. Let the hate guide you. 

God i wish thats true, i have been living alone in the US for the past 5 years with no friends, and man, everyday i keep hoping to run into someone familiar.Edit: word.

Honestly, I&#39;m going to go a different route with this post:  When I was a kid, I definitely did think it was cool to see friends randomly outside of school.  But now as an adult,  I want to be left alone.  I have no friends so the next level of &quot;people I know&quot; would be former high school classmates and I HATE it when they see me and approach me.  Theres a good reason why I didn&#39;t keep in touch with them but some people didn&#39;t get the memo. 

That&#39;s because they&#39;re not friends you&#39;re seeing at the store, they&#39;re acquaintances.

I never really understood why people don&#39;t like seeing people they don&#39;t know, it makes the world feel smaller; and I hardly talk to anybody anyway, so when I have a chance to talk to somebody I haven&#39;t seen in a while I&#39;ll take it. It&#39;s healthy to &#39;perform human conversation&#39; if you don&#39;t get the chance often.

It&#39;s quite the other way around for me.As a kid you are constantly surrounded by acquaintances and friends so I didn&#39;t want to run into them eveb more. As adult everyone is on a schedule and has no time it would be nice to occassionally run into them unscheduled.

Awspry? More like Aspie.

Being a socially awkward child, I hated seeing friends at the mall. I was unable to create conversation outside of school for some reason.

This is me every time I walk into the Best Buy near my house that I used to work at. I just want to get in, get my shit and go, but inevitably I always run into someone there I used to work with.

Heh.. try being semi &#39;famous&#39; in a large city.  There was a time, thankfully WAY in my past, that I couldn&#39;t go to the mall, a movie, or out to eat, without running into ten people who &#39;knew&#39; me.  It was cool for a while but it turned into an ass whip pretty fast.  I really LOVE being anonymous now.  

That&#39;s because you like your friends as a child.

I don&#39;t even pretend. I don&#39;t make eye contact, and just make no notice of their presence unless they want my attention. There&#39;s no need for small talk unless you want to talk to me, and I don&#39;t mind occupying my time.

When you were a kid, like elementary school, did you ever run into a teacher outside of school and think &quot;what the fuck are you doing here? you only exist at school!&quot; It only happened a few times to me and I remember each one cause it screwed with my head at the time. And here&#39;s a twist as an adult. I get along really well with my wifes family that live in a little town a few hours away. I go out there often by myself to hunt and fish with her brothers and nephews. So much that I see people at the grocery store when I am by myself that I have met while with the inlaws. Then it&#39;s like &quot;what the hell now? I usually see you when I am with Eric, what the fuck do I say?&quot; 

I feel the same as op, but without the apologetic sidenote, I do hate people and have no friends

We solve our problems by doing everything online.
Our supermarket is literally a 3min walk away.

TIL I&#39;m an adult at 13

OP sounds like a classic introvert under the belief this behavior is a result of adulthood. Interesting.

When I was a kid my mum used to say &#39;why do I always run into people when I have greasy hair?&#39; 
Rather than pick up on that she meant &#39;just my luck to run into people when I have greasy hair!&#39;, I instead thought she was implying there was a causal relationship and grew up thinking greasy hair made you more likely to run into people. 

Friends? Bah, just the casual acquaintances

Had a kid ask me at the restaurant I work at on weekends if I work at their elementary school - I smiled and said yes. I couldn‚Äôt tell him how I wish the school paid me more. 

Do Americans not shop online? I‚Äôve not done a full shop at the grocery store for about 6 years now.

similar but i don&#39;t remember a time when i was a kid when it felt different. i guess it&#39;s about feeling like you&#39;re wearing a mask when  you&#39;re an adult and you want some time when you don&#39;t have to wear it (and be out of the house at the same time).  i guess i always felt like i was wearing a mask. (scary.)
when do you think it shifted for you?

My experience is that it starts off as the usual run-of-the-mill &quot;how are you?&quot; then typically nose- dives into a penis measuring contest of how good their life is and I pretend to be excited...which I suck at doing.

That&#39;s why you should order your groceries instead. Until you find out the delivery guy is an old friend from high school.

Nah, my mom ALWAYS embarrassed me in public, towards my adulthood, she normally went every in sweatpants with old dried on paint or something stupid. I don&#39;t think seeing people in public was every pleasant. 

As a Kid I hated it when my mom ran into people she knew in the stores, while I disliked running into anyone I knew when she wasn&#39;t busy cause I wouldn&#39;t be able to talk to them.  
Now I just decide how long I stay myself so now running into people I know in the city is nice

I think it depends who you are. I like running into people and have a chat. I even chat with stranger while shopping. 

Oh God, this is me all over üò®

This is not true.... where did you get this from?  I still enjoy running into friends, I just don‚Äôt wanna run into someone I know that I feel obligated to stop and talk just because I know them.  This was the same when I was a kid too....

As kids we think it&#39;s cool when we run into friends at the mall or grocery store.
Unless we were with our parents.

&quot;Does anyone else adults and children are different?lmfaoooo&quot;

Nah I hated running into friends as a kid too. 

I‚Äôm so with you on this! I just had to go to two supermarkets and I‚Äôm temporarily living in the town I grew up in (moving next week) and I see the people I knew as kids and they are so backwards it actually breaks my heart.

Such is the life of the introvert. I can totally sympathize with you on this sentiment.

Is this an introvert kind of thing? Honestly curious. I personally only care about seeing people I know if it‚Äôs people I‚Äôm barely acquaintances with but even then it‚Äôs barely a whole 90 seconds out of my life. Is it that draining for some of you?

I get it! 

I mean, I don‚Äôt want to see anyone I know because the only people I know AND like are nowhere near me (and few and far between).  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with hating people.  

Dude you should read this book called Quiet, by Susan Cane. It changed my life. I think you would like it

Move to a foreign country and don&#39;t make friends.  Been working for me for 5 years.

I saw my buddy at the grocery store Saturday morning at like 8am. We were like i guess we&#39;re old men now chatting at the store first thing inn the morning on a weekend.    

Fucking hate small talk

I guess Reddit is just full of people who don&#39;t like people. I like running into people I know when I am out. Get to chat, change the tempo of my day a bit from the planned route.

As a question to all adults, how come you don&#39;t like running into people you know? Not 18 yet so

Most adults lose themselves in the mundane aspects of day to day life. They no longer foster real friendships with people that they have things in common with.
Imagine a scenario where you‚Äôre married, have kids and work an 8-5 M-F. You have zero time to yourself at this point. Most of, if not all your interactions are associations with people from work, people from your kid‚Äôs activities or superficial acquaintances that you‚Äôve decided to pretend you have things in common with so you can partially escape your boredom from time to time.
Now imagine you‚Äôre out doing one of the many tasks that takes up time you would rather spend doing something else and then you run into one on these people that remind you of the monotony of your life and how much you wish you could be free form it.

It was never cool to me, ever.

I&#39;m 14 and I hope I don&#39;t run into anyone. Introversion spans generations

Must suck to be that socially awkward and afraid of human interaction.

yes it does.

Unless you&#39;re a mother because then you&#39;ll talk to that person for 3 hours.

I&#39;m the opposite, and I&#39;m 16. Ok, let me clarify, if I see a friend, I dont mind, but if I see a person from school that i know, and they know me, and we are mere acquaintances, I pray they dont say anything.... Especially if its a girl. Because then my parents want to know who they are, what classes i have with them, is she cute........ And on and on and on.

No no.  That&#39;s college life.  The morning walk of shame where you hope no one sees you with your clothe from last night.

In college you HOPE to be seen on that walk to raise your social status.
