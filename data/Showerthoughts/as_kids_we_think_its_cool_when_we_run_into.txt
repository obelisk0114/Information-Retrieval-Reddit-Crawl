Edit: A lot of you seem to think that I absolutely hate people. That&#39;s not the case. I have a lot of friends and enjoy being around them...in a controlled environment. I have to be prepared for social interaction. So my desire to not see people I know when running errands isn&#39;t cuz I hate people, but simply because I&#39;m not prepared to interact with them. The situation is out of my control, and that&#39;s very stressful for me.


UnknownVariation     Sun Feb 4 00:40:54 2018 UTC

It’s the difference between running into friends and running into acquaintances.
Seeing your best friend at the store is a fun little coincidence. Seeing that one guy from your 9th grade math class is painfully uncomfortable.
You both simultaneously made and dropped eye contact, you <em>know</em> they recognized you, but the <strong>only</strong> commonality is the school you attended. Afterwards, you don’t leave your house for a decade.


bcs1225     Sun Feb 4 09:59:28 2018 UTC

Though let me tell you, NOTHING in this world is worse than going to your hometown for a visit and running into your high school ex. That&#39;s some shit that will make you either never leave the house, or never the house without makeup again. 


throw_awaybusiness     Sun Feb 4 12:23:58 2018 UTC

It&#39;s been 2 years and I still think about running into my ex/dropped friends everytime I leave the house :/ social anxiety sucks


reinakun     Sun Feb 4 12:49:02 2018 UTC

Don&#39;t feel bad. I used to avoid my ex-best friend&#39;s area even though we literally lived 5 blocks away from each other.  Whenever I took the bus home I&#39;d stay on a stop longer even though it meant extending my walk home by another 15 minutes because the stop I SHOULD have gotten off was directly in front of her house.
Hell, I once saw her when I was out with my sister and I literally dropped to the floor and hid behind a car.
Social anxiety ftw. /s


bcs1225     Sun Feb 4 18:18:26 2018 UTC

My ex moved to another state with an extremely slim chance of moving back after 2 years. I knew for a fact he didn&#39;t but still feared seeing him at some of his old hangout places. I get it dude, it sucks. 


MissTricorn     Sun Feb 4 15:22:09 2018 UTC

You know you&#39;re in a comfortable zone with a good friend when you start shopping together (and neither person minds) and judging each other&#39;s purchases (Again like shooting the shit, not that bitch Karen from the PTA questioning why you have non organic items in your cart.)


ILennart     Sun Feb 4 10:31:10 2018 UTC

Perhaps now that we&#39;ve got the problem, we can think of a solution..? What we should do in a situation like that so it isn&#39;t uncomfortable

DorsWors     Sat Feb 3 22:54:49 2018 UTC

The worst is when you run into someone you know in one aisle, do your obligatory chat, run into them a few aisles down, and have to pretend you don&#39;t see them, or do the &quot;long time no see&quot; bullshit small talk, pretending it&#39;s funny.

Damn it had this happen today. Saw a cute dog and was talking to the owner than thought we&#39;d go our own ways.. nope up the same steep sidewalk together!


CheesypoofExtreme     Sun Feb 4 09:59:21 2018 UTC

Similar situation a few days ago at my apartment building. Get off the elevator on the same floor as a guy and say goodbye after chatting. I walk off first with my dog, and realize about midway down the hallway we&#39;re going the same way...when I hit my door I awkwardly say &quot;Oh crap, didn&#39;t realize you lived down this far!&quot; and he responds, &quot;yeah I&#39;m all the way at the end&quot; 


Buerdax     Sun Feb 4 07:15:35 2018 UTC

When that happens i sometimes walk in the wrong direction on purpose, then I either wait long enough until the other person has walked far enough from me or I take a way that leads me home but is longer and goes trough somewhere else. 


heyugl     Sun Feb 4 11:17:28 2018 UTC

buckydean     Sun Feb 4 03:11:19 2018 UTC

I live in a small town and it&#39;s pretty common to run into people you know at the store. When we&#39;re done talking I always end it with &quot;well take care, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see each other a few more times here.&quot; Then every time we run into each other on the next aisle or whatever we just exchange a funny little glance like &quot;told you!&quot; and go about our shopping.


Superpickle18     Sun Feb 4 08:39:26 2018 UTC

I have become very skilled at looking like I’m too busy to notice anyone around me. Its for their benefit as much as it is for mine. 


GeraltofCanada     Sun Feb 4 04:17:12 2018 UTC

The awkward faked smile and nod the second time. Gahhhhhhhh


_furioushamster     Sun Feb 4 05:02:50 2018 UTC

God I will actually go all the way down to the end and “backwards” shop (like, not my normal routine through the grocery store)  to avoid seeing them every fucking aisle. My worse fear is someone else doing the same thing and we run into each other on the opposite side of the store. 


Nickvr628     Sun Feb 4 06:24:06 2018 UTC

Now you have to forward shop in anticipation of their backwards shop.


Geosaysbye     Sun Feb 4 03:51:00 2018 UTC

That’s why I always say “see you around!” When I end the conversation just in case I literally do se them around the store again hahaha


Hellkitedrak     Sun Feb 4 05:16:20 2018 UTC

No the second time I look at them making sure they know I see them then dont say a word. 


malmad     Sun Feb 4 04:45:49 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t even bother. I see someone i know, unless they are a GOOD friend, I give them the head nod up and keep moving without saying a word.


Jazzremix     Sun Feb 4 09:01:47 2018 UTC

My girlfriend thought I was weird for doing this. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to say hi?&quot; &quot;I just did&quot;. Then I had to explain the difference between the upwards nod and the downwards nod.


747173     Sun Feb 4 11:30:21 2018 UTC

Uh what is the difference between the upwards and downwards nod? I thought they were interchangeable...


troubleleaving     Sun Feb 4 11:38:48 2018 UTC

The upwards nod is for people that you are friends with. It&#39;s basically &#39;sup&#39;. The downwards nod is for people you know but aren&#39;t friends with, so teachers, acquaintances, etc. It&#39;s sort of like &quot;carry on&quot;. 
Maybe it&#39;s a regional thing since OP seems to be using it the opposite way. 


cmneiki     Sun Feb 4 12:37:51 2018 UTC

I feel like the downwards nod is more respectful like “good day to you” and then the upwards nod is more like “sup bitch”.  That might just be me though.


Wartz     Sun Feb 4 12:04:22 2018 UTC

Exactly how I use it. 


newsposts     Sun Feb 4 05:46:07 2018 UTC

This is where honesty comes handy, both of you are thinking it so ask each other, how you deal with this? The more you are open with people, the closer you get to them, the more &quot;weird shit&quot; you can do around them with no worries. 


T-MinusGiraffe     Sun Feb 4 05:49:18 2018 UTC

Some of the most awkward moments of my life was after I&#39;d signed someone&#39;s senior yearbook who I didn&#39;t expect to see again, got the relationship tied off all nice and then saw them in the hall like 30 seconds later.


jospebody     Sun Feb 4 11:36:22 2018 UTC

Everytime this has happened to me, I just smile and wave, maybe say &quot;hi&quot; as I walk past, and continue without ever stopping. Never had an encounter where this didn&#39;t work.


whatthefunkmaster     Sun Feb 4 12:41:13 2018 UTC

Eye contact, smile and nod. Very simple, not stress inducing at all. Just basic human interactions 101


arjunmohan     Sun Feb 4 13:09:59 2018 UTC

NotoriousSmiter     Sun Feb 4 11:35:56 2018 UTC

Engaging with them again is always preferable to pretending you didn&#39;t notice them a second time, it&#39;s way less awkward.

I totally agree with the OP. When I was a kid(which I still am 😂) I got really excited when ran into anyone I knew from school. This dragged all the way to high school. Now I don’t want to bump into anyone I know from work, colleague or client, or even any member of my own family at a grocery store or a shopping mall. I’d be in a fkking space if I see one of them. I just want to stay focus on what I’m getting because I always have plan after those kind of trips. Fukk, I could use some coffee right now😄

That&#39;s actually what sparked this thought.

And all I could do was stand there thinking to myself, &quot;But why?&quot;


BenjerminGray     Sun Feb 4 00:16:24 2018 UTC

If the friendship was genuinely good, usually instead of dreading seeing them you miss them. I dread seeing my family in the Bronx but seeing my cousin who was practically a brother to me after so many years made me feel like a kid again.  And despite the time he instantly opened up to me. As if no time had passed whatsoever.


Spartini     Sun Feb 4 01:16:44 2018 UTC

I&#39;m 23 and love running in to my friends!

PointyPython     Sun Feb 4 05:27:13 2018 UTC

I&#39;m about your age and it&#39;s the same for me. Sure, you do run into some annoying people ocassionaly, but it really does brighten up your day to randomly run into someone you haven&#39;t seen in a while. For example, the other day at the butcher&#39;s I ran into a teacher I had in high school who I was really close to back then. It was great; the &quot;what the hell are you doing here!&quot; look we both had in our faces for like half a minute was priceless. We got to exchange numbers and arranged to have coffee sometime with her and my sister (who also had her). We both then got to chat with her again, catch up on life and get advice from her on academic stuff.
Anyway, lesson is a) to try to cultivate relationships that&#39;ll turn chance re-encounters into random joyous events b) all that wouldn&#39;t have happened if I bought my beef online or something.


Theycallmelizardboy     Sun Feb 4 08:09:51 2018 UTC

It&#39;s because both men had met at work and what started as a friendly coworker situation blossomed into pure lust and they eventually fell madly in love. Both men were happily married at the time but secretly began seeing each other behind their wives back. Then one day, one of the wives found out and drover herself off a cliff rather than live the lie anymore. The death of his wife destroyed him but the other consoled him during his difficult time. They decided to get married but a job offer that was too good to be true came up and they had to split ways. 15 years went by. During that time both men had gone straight again, got married again, had several children and moved on. They coincidentally both started Thai food cart businesses and were both shopping for basil when they ran into each other at the grocery store you were at.

Last time it happened I was shopping. She never noticed me because I was too shy and tried avoid her. I carted into line to see the cashier and she pulled in behind me. We had a good laugh about chance meetings and how lonely we were and how sometimes the universe forces people to meet each other when they’re meant to be together. I said goodbye, she kissed my cheek, then I walked away. Talk about awkward conversations.

There is a chick that works at the grocery store near my home that I went to high school with.  We graduated together 15 years ago.  I have lived and shopped near this store for 12 years now.  I&#39;m pretty sure we actively avoid each other, I saw her today even and we said nothing.


PuttyGod     Sun Feb 4 15:53:06 2018 UTC

Sounds like sexual tension to me. Do something about it and you&#39;ll both chill out.

It sucks when you see someone and you only remember that they were in your high school and and you’re internally screaming (DON’T LOCK EYES WITH HIN DON’T LOCK EYES WITH HIM) <em>locks eyes</em> (FUCK)


TooShiftyForYou     Sat Feb 3 23:41:11 2018 UTC

When you see someone you know but pretend not to see them even though you&#39;re pretty sure they just did the same thing to you.


Biggyhefty     Sun Feb 4 00:24:49 2018 UTC

I did this to my sister at TJ Maxx yesterday. 


ananda_yogi     Sun Feb 4 02:45:29 2018 UTC

Idk why but this really made me giggle


AgentUnknown821     Sun Feb 4 04:41:00 2018 UTC

Lmao what an ass. 


watson1984     Sat Feb 3 22:32:59 2018 UTC

I sometimes wear disguises like hats or sunglasses in the hope that if I bump into someone I know they won’t see me. I don’t know why I fear meeting people so much because it’s never that bad when I do 


Awspry     Sat Feb 3 22:35:39 2018 UTC

I know the feeling. I feel naked when I go out without a hat on. And when I see someone first and initiate contact it&#39;s fine. But I have an irrational fear of people recognizing me.


ananda_yogi     Sun Feb 4 02:48:07 2018 UTC

Except you gotta take off your disguise at the bank. Just happened to me yesterday in line. Avoided eye contact, checked over my deposit slip 5 times, and he still waited to walk away from his teller until I walked towards mine so he could go in for the hello and hug.  


fshowcars     Sun Feb 4 11:44:58 2018 UTC

Conversely, I wear hats to work and constantly out... So now people know my cover, and it&#39;s blown.  It blows


justin3189     Sun Feb 4 00:50:47 2018 UTC

i have a story from 8th grade. it was 9:00 pm and it was just me and my dad for the weekend so of course we had to stop by the store to grab ice cream in the way home from wrestling. My dad just hands me some money to go in and grab it(he was on a conference call) I proceed to run into a group of (might I say some not to ugly) girls I have classes with, they were wearing only bath robes. It was hilarious, they seemed super embarrassed/surprised to see someone from school lol. After we talked a minute or two we went on our ways, and I could hear one girl squeal to her friend &quot;you said there was no way anyone who we know would see us&quot; I tried not to laugh as I walked on to get ice cream. All around good day.


TheDevilsAdvokaat     Sun Feb 4 03:46:17 2018 UTC

As a teacher, the last thing I want to see when out to lunch is one of my students.....they&#39;re almost always friendly and come over to talk but honestly I just want to quietly eat my food and get out....


p3p3si1via     Sun Feb 4 00:56:30 2018 UTC

Posts like this make me think that everyone else is as introverted as me, but then I see people going out of their way to socialize and I don&#39;t know what to think. 


Elyou243     Sun Feb 4 02:14:33 2018 UTC

Introverts are more prone to Reddit 


TheBeardofGilgamesh     Sun Feb 4 08:20:24 2018 UTC

I was about to say that.

What is it about this site that makes us flock to it 


Dr_4gon     Sun Feb 4 17:39:17 2018 UTC

Well... Spending more time inside or looking at your phone raises the stakes for discovering and using reddit as opposed to going out, meeting people I guess


zperic1     Sun Feb 4 10:55:47 2018 UTC

Don&#39;t overthink it. You like comfy social circumstances and you don&#39;t need that big of an amount of social feedback to gather perspective on your life. As someone who goes out of his way to socialize, I function the other way round. I like the vibe of new people, I like seeing new faces and hearing new stories. Our loud culture makes introverts seem like some maladapted people, and those who know better understand that this is not the case. If I werw your colleagues, I would avoid you in a mall although I would be very eager to hear how&#39;s your day going. :) 


AgentUnknown821     Sun Feb 4 04:44:47 2018 UTC

I&#39;m an introvert and I use social media alot. Now socialize in real life? Depends on the person..If the person doesn&#39;t interest me, is new or I knew him as an ass chances are very low for a conversation starter but it&#39;s a different story online. 


TheMostToastyToast     Sun Feb 4 02:11:02 2018 UTC

No, Steve, I don&#39;t want to hear about your kids. I&#39;m tired, I worked all day, and I just want to go home and eat my pretzels.


LinShuLe     Sun Feb 4 06:23:21 2018 UTC

Happy cake day! I hope you have a wonderful day :) 


zperic1     Sun Feb 4 08:59:40 2018 UTC

I love bumping into people I know and having a chat. Especially as I am supe busy all the time and can&#39;t make it to see everyone. To avoid being a Steve, I always shoot the how are yous first to feel the ground. I hope if we were friends, you&#39;d appreciate that and tell me genuinely how you feel. 


Unsurehowigothere     Sun Feb 4 06:29:50 2018 UTC

I would think you’d prefer toast over pretzels


FightTheFallen     Sun Feb 4 03:12:01 2018 UTC

I think it&#39;s more of a culture shift. In certain small-town and regions life is a bit slower and people still enjoy striking up conversations with their friends and even random strangers we see in public. In more modern and fast paced urban environments people just want to get their shit and get home. 


theexitisontheleft     Sat Feb 3 23:23:29 2018 UTC

I always feel exposed waiting at the bus stop in my neighborhood. I’ve had this one particular person I’d rather avoid walk by too many times and there’s no place to hide so I have to talk to him. 


FilmHugsBearKisses     Sat Feb 3 23:30:23 2018 UTC

The older I get, the more accurate this becomes 


RacG79     Sun Feb 4 04:04:39 2018 UTC

To anyone who saw me in a grocery store and avoided me, thank you! If I saw you then I probably did the same. And I didn&#39;t want to talk to anyone anyway so it&#39;s all good.


pollodustino     Sun Feb 4 04:59:30 2018 UTC

I stopped going to the Home Depot I used to work at because I didn&#39;t want to have to stop and chat with my old co-workers.
Even ten years later some of them are still there.  Unless I really don&#39;t mind having a short chat I&#39;ll go four miles out of my way to another store to pick up six bolts and a couple light bulbs.


T30H     Sun Feb 4 00:14:51 2018 UTC

If it&#39;s someone I actually liked I&#39;ll probably say hi (if I think they&#39;ll remember me; you can tell if they do or not), but if it&#39;s someone I don&#39;t care to see, then I just ignore, feel no obligation to say hi. I think lot of ppl are like that; you just get this vibe when you get into a situation like that lol


ericswift     Sun Feb 4 06:36:40 2018 UTC

This should be simple for men. If you recognize them but don&#39;t want to talk, you do &quot;the nod.&quot;


jcgurango     Sun Feb 4 11:45:46 2018 UTC

Some people take that as a sign to go up and talk to you though. 


T30H     Sun Feb 4 17:43:48 2018 UTC

Yep, the &quot;nod&quot; thing does simplify stuff lol


rockyhide     Sun Feb 4 04:39:09 2018 UTC

But you know what’s worse?
Working in a mall or grocery store.
“Oh what are you doing here?”
“Working, Debbie. The mall has to have employees.”


mhwmhw     Sun Feb 4 04:49:22 2018 UTC

I remember when I was a kid I would give the &quot;sup&quot; nod.


JoseSpiknSpan     Sun Feb 4 05:28:03 2018 UTC

No, I&#39;ve tried to avoid interacting with people I know in public for as long as I can remember. Of course this only applies to unscheduled interactions. 


wamkitten     Sun Feb 4 01:28:31 2018 UTC

WOW.  this is so me today.  or everyday really.  but i honestly just came home from the supermarket and thinking to myself &#39;i hope i don&#39;t see anyone&#39; over and over.


scyIla     Sun Feb 4 04:44:33 2018 UTC

Relatable. Seen an old coworker at the liquor store today. I went in unnoticed.. came out speed walking to my car when i hear them call my name when i only reply &quot;YO!&quot; with no eye contact and continue walking away to my car to avoid human interaction. Thats normal.. Right?


Infin1ty     Sun Feb 4 08:10:36 2018 UTC

The grocery store I go to is frequented by a bunch of people I work with and I fucking hate running into them. The only thing worse is running into the neighbors.


hudson27     Sun Feb 4 04:16:49 2018 UTC

As a 25 year old, I&#39;ve been microdosing to help with my depression. I also bus to the farthest grocery store because I like to listen to music alone. So when someone I know sits next to me on the bus, while I&#39;m tripping listening to tunes,  I relate to this on a whole other level


Losman94     Sun Feb 4 02:38:40 2018 UTC

QuickDazingFireball     Sun Feb 4 02:19:44 2018 UTC

Because small talk sucks. It just does. It&#39;s social filler to ease you into whatever actual topic you need to talk about. You need to give your cousin news about your mom getting cancer? Can&#39;t just come right out with it, ask them how their day is first. You&#39;re at work and need to sell someone something? Can&#39;t just say &quot;Did you hear about our deals on life insurance,&quot; gotta introduce yourself first.
Moreover, being in a grocery store sucks. You&#39;re there because you have to be, you want to get whatever shit you need and get back to doing shit you enjoy/are getting paid for. Grocery stores are a place you go because there&#39;s not really a better way to get the things you need to live.
So when you&#39;re at a grocery store, going through the list of things you need and just wanting to get it done, and running into Bill from the office who you really don&#39;t know that well, it&#39;s a huge waste of time. Basically you&#39;re going through small talk at a place you don&#39;t want to be for no real reason other than social obligation. Bill is keeping you from doing whatever else you want/need to do in your day, even if it&#39;s only for a minute.
As a kid, the grocery store sucks, but you don&#39;t have the choice to leave, and small talk... well, it&#39;s unnecessary. Kids kinda just say what they want to say because they don&#39;t have those social obligations to fulfill. 
So you&#39;re stuck there, your parents are the ones who have the choice to leave, and they need to buy a ton of shit because they have you around and they need to feed you. Any distraction from that, especially when you&#39;re a kid and very prone to distractions as it is, is a welcome one. Someone you know is even better, because they&#39;re actually helping you waste time until your parents grab their shit and tell you they&#39;re ready to leave already.


darksideofthemoon131     Sun Feb 4 03:13:20 2018 UTC

Can&#39;t agree more, since I do my errands on my day off, never shave, live in sweats for the day and my eyes are usually red because I smoked a joint before. Of course those days I almost ALWAYS run into someone. Days when I actually put forth effort and use eye drops? Not a single person...


templestate     Sun Feb 4 00:50:06 2018 UTC

This is the truest truth I’ve ever seen


MaesterOfPanic     Sun Feb 4 03:01:38 2018 UTC

Try working at a grocery store. I spend half my day dodging people I went to high school with.

Kitteh311     Sun Feb 4 06:14:06 2018 UTC

I&#39;m so glad you posted this.  It&#39;s beyond true!  I thought I had just become kind of negative, but that&#39;s not the case.  I just like...I dunno having plans to interact with people.  I also suffer from debilitating anxiety.


Jk14m     Sun Feb 4 06:14:10 2018 UTC

I hated running into people while out... it was always awkward, and I would’ve rather just had a peaceful time with my family. 


KMnO4inyourpants     Sat Feb 3 23:29:36 2018 UTC

I think it depends on the person. I’m fairly extroverted, so I enjoy running into people. Living in a big city, it’s kind of a treat to see people you know among the anonymous crowds.

GregorSamsaa     Sun Feb 4 03:51:24 2018 UTC

I never wanted to run into friends when I was out by myself as a kid.

Painfully true.


Kingpiratee     Sun Feb 4 04:39:10 2018 UTC

So true, i hate meeting friends now, it feels so AWKWARD :(


throwawayfae112     Sun Feb 4 04:46:53 2018 UTC

Lol I was the exact opposite.  I hated running into friends out and about when I was a kid.  As an adult I actually hope it happens, because with working full time basically year round it&#39;s a good opportunity to catch up with people when you don&#39;t have time to really hang out with them.


SaraBinks     Sun Feb 4 05:42:24 2018 UTC

Seeing people you know when you are aware that you&#39;re not looking your best.

It&#39;s neat I like it, I don&#39;t go out with the intentions but if I bump into someone I know I&#39;ll say hi


DarkDoesThings     Sun Feb 4 02:01:48 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve always hated it.


neeliemich     Sun Feb 4 02:22:54 2018 UTC

My aunts and mom always seem to run into people when they’re grocery shopping, and always when I’m with them. I usually walk around the entire store like 3 or 4 times waiting on them to stop talking (they can talk for like 30 minutes 🤦🏻‍♀️) 


ericstern     Sun Feb 4 02:35:27 2018 UTC

Back in the early 2000s I would have to put on a beanie and shades so that nobody I knew would recognize me when I’m shopping. 
Thank god for modern internet shopping. I can get all the porn I want from the comfort of my own home!

I saw someone from work on a Saturday at Home Depot.
Unfortunately I hadn&#39;t changed clothes since I saw him last a couple days prior.   I hadn&#39;t combed my hair or taken a shower.  
Luckily he didn&#39;t notice me. I just turned around and walked the other way.

plasticsporks21     Sun Feb 4 13:14:03 2018 UTC

I was pulling into a grocery store parking lot and saw a coworker. I avoided parking near them and made sure to avoid going anywhere in their vicinity... Only to run into another coworker in the produce aisle and I had to talk to her and her fucking husband and I was so mad. 


Qubeye     Sun Feb 4 16:42:36 2018 UTC

As children, we realize people can be kind.
As teenagers we realize people can be cruel.
As adults we realize people can be two-faced.
I don&#39;t like Small Talk because it always feels like people are hiding what they are really thinking. I just want to get on with my day and let alone.


I_HaveAHat     Sun Feb 4 02:47:42 2018 UTC

avgjoe017     Sun Feb 4 02:20:57 2018 UTC

Speaking with such generalities. It&#39;s like everyone on Reddit has social anxiety. You know this isn&#39;t normal, right?


ItsWoodenshoe     Sat Feb 3 23:16:19 2018 UTC

As a kid with social anxiety I always have felt like that :’)

I had no idea so many people hated the world. I love running into people I know.


Awspry     Sun Feb 4 04:36:54 2018 UTC

Just because I don&#39;t want to run into people doesn&#39;t mean I hate the world. I enjoy seeing people I know too, when it&#39;s in a controlled environment. If I know I&#39;m going out with friends, or going to a party, or whatever, then great. But if I&#39;m at the grocery store, seeing you is interrupting my routine and it&#39;s a social exchange I was not prepared for. And that&#39;s a very stressful thing for me.


x-Mowens-x     Sun Feb 4 13:08:36 2018 UTC

A &quot;controlled environment&quot; party sounds like a hoot. 


Jimid41     Sun Feb 4 06:11:10 2018 UTC

What happened between being excited to see people as a child and hating it as an adult that made spontaneous social interaction stressful?

RB25POWER     Sun Feb 4 04:12:34 2018 UTC

Flashback to 13 year old me. I had a crush on this girl and ran into her and her friends at a movie theater while I was with my parents. I figured I&#39;d go over to say hi but I was definitely not smooth.<blockquote>
Me: Hey [insert name here]!!! What are you doing here?!
Her: Watching a movie...
Her friends: * cringing *
Me: <em>Walks away cringing</em>
My Parents: <em>Also cringing</em>


smartcool     Sun Feb 4 00:31:50 2018 UTC

You make adulthood sound terrifying.   How can I avoid this fate?


Awspry     Sun Feb 4 01:04:00 2018 UTC

Learn early on that everyone is the hero of their own story, and unless you&#39;re a main character in it, they probably don&#39;t think twice about you. It sounds depressing, until you realize that it means all those awkward and embarrassing moments that haunt you are long forgotten by others.
Show kindness to others, even if they don&#39;t deserve it, that way if you do have a bad relationship with someone, it&#39;s not your fault. And if you have a good one, any time seeing them is a pleasant one.


cellardoor122     Sun Feb 4 03:36:21 2018 UTC

GoEagles247     Sun Feb 4 05:13:59 2018 UTC

Nah these people are just introverted as fuck. I enjoy running into friends for the most part. We&#39;re friends. Why would I not like seeing them
Ran into a friend at the store the other day and we ended up grabbing lunch. It was fun 


Bardini     Sat Feb 3 23:16:49 2018 UTC

I&#39;m at the point where sometimes I hope I run into someone I know or able to pretend I didn&#39;t see them, so I can assure myself I still know people outside my family. But it just never happens though...

The_Golden_Voice     Sun Feb 4 02:29:49 2018 UTC

An old classmate just came into my retail job with his hot wife earlier today. I rang them up. Being much chunkier than I was in HS I was praying he wouldn&#39;t recognize me but he did.
He was still cool and all but I was still embarrassed. :(


HordeofSheep     Sun Feb 4 02:51:02 2018 UTC

I live in the same town as a guy I knew in college who I awkwardly fell out of touch with. The other day I walked into the grocery store late at night and he was literally the only other person there, standing in the aisle directly in front of where the entry doors are. As soon as the doors opened he looked over at me before there was time for me to turn around and walk out.


forgetasitype     Sun Feb 4 03:26:37 2018 UTC

You introvert


lorddimwit     Sun Feb 4 03:40:24 2018 UTC

I&#39;m 37. There are a few friends that if I ran into them at the store we&#39;d team up and do our shopping together...but other than those few, yeah. It starts to get real awkward around the &quot;our kids are friends but I&#39;m not even sure I know your last name&quot; tier.

Oh man! I was walking home from work yesterday and saw an old friend of my Mom. She was doing one of those canvassing for a third party gas/electric company. Asked me if I’d be interested. 
Like a dumbass I said yes. 
She tells me to say yes to everything they ask me...first sign it was sketch. 
It comes time for me to answer all these questions and it just gets sketchier. Eventually I said no because they wanted to enroll me in a 3 year contract with cancellation fees. They couldn’t tell me anything more about how it was gonna work. Nope, nope, and another hard nope. 
She ended up calling me  asking what’s wrong and I told her I just couldn’t do it. I read the reviews about it online and it was NOTHING but bad reviews. She tried to assure me that it was the competitors writing crappy reviews but it was just weird.

Haha, try living on a tiny island. I can&#39;t go for a night out or a trip the the store without bumping into people I know. It can be a hit oppressive, but on the whole, it&#39;s really nice. There&#39;s something that really puts a smile on your face about seeing old friends run into o eyes another. 


Pedrophile101     Sun Feb 4 04:24:10 2018 UTC

Nope, that’s me as a kid too

The difference is who is buying


johndehlinmademedoit     Sun Feb 4 04:58:52 2018 UTC

Apples and oranges.
As a kid, going to the mall is a social outing used mostly for fun.  As an adult, going grocery store is a chore that has to get done.
A more apt comparison as an adult would be like running into a friend at a concert, farmers market, etc, and I think that’s something most adults enjoy.


Yaboifuckboi     Sun Feb 4 05:12:26 2018 UTC

Exactly, I would rather be like wanna hang (certain place/time) than randomly see them and have to have an interaction I didn&#39;t plan. 


Mechasteel     Sun Feb 4 06:37:53 2018 UTC

You don&#39;t have to make small talk if you don&#39;t want to. Is your theory that anytime people who know each other meet they have to spend a long time talking, and that both people hate doing so but do it anyways?


kafkian73     Sun Feb 4 06:42:00 2018 UTC

Absolutely. I don&#39;t hate people, but I do hate the small talk and that&#39;s what happens at those encounters.


ww2colorizations     Sun Feb 4 06:42:23 2018 UTC

Ha so true. I didn’t like going to the local grocery store in high school because I was always high as fuck and would run into friends parents everytime 


airbear13     Sun Feb 4 06:45:27 2018 UTC

Nah I hated it when I was a kid even. I very rarely hung out with people outside of the school for the  same reasons as you probably; it just takes a lot of psyching up to face all of that social chaos.


bohnjatman     Sun Feb 4 07:04:12 2018 UTC

This is not true for everyone, don&#39;t feel weird if it doesn&#39;t apply to you.


8-bit-eyes     Sun Feb 4 07:16:06 2018 UTC

Speak for yourself brah. I go to the mall specifically to fun into people I know. Very rarely do I find people boring.

God i wish thats true, i have been living alone in the US for the past 5 years with no friends, and man, everyday i keep hoping to run into someone familiar.Edit: word.


drewwheel001     Sun Feb 4 09:19:12 2018 UTC

Honestly, I&#39;m going to go a different route with this post:  When I was a kid, I definitely did think it was cool to see friends randomly outside of school.  But now as an adult,  I want to be left alone.  I have no friends so the next level of &quot;people I know&quot; would be former high school classmates and I HATE it when they see me and approach me.  Theres a good reason why I didn&#39;t keep in touch with them but some people didn&#39;t get the memo. 


hmfskmn     Sun Feb 4 09:28:03 2018 UTC

That&#39;s because they&#39;re not friends you&#39;re seeing at the store, they&#39;re acquaintances.


Zaareish     Sun Feb 4 09:34:19 2018 UTC

I never really understood why people don&#39;t like seeing people they don&#39;t know, it makes the world feel smaller; and I hardly talk to anybody anyway, so when I have a chance to talk to somebody I haven&#39;t seen in a while I&#39;ll take it. It&#39;s healthy to &#39;perform human conversation&#39; if you don&#39;t get the chance often.


OneAttentionPlease     Sun Feb 4 09:48:16 2018 UTC

It&#39;s quite the other way around for me.As a kid you are constantly surrounded by acquaintances and friends so I didn&#39;t want to run into them eveb more. As adult everyone is on a schedule and has no time it would be nice to occassionally run into them unscheduled.


Maxwe4     Sun Feb 4 09:55:08 2018 UTC

Awspry? More like Aspie.


NerdCate     Sun Feb 4 09:57:07 2018 UTC

Being a socially awkward child, I hated seeing friends at the mall. I was unable to create conversation outside of school for some reason.


t0ny510     Sun Feb 4 10:07:38 2018 UTC

This is me every time I walk into the Best Buy near my house that I used to work at. I just want to get in, get my shit and go, but inevitably I always run into someone there I used to work with.


AlbusQ     Sun Feb 4 10:07:38 2018 UTC

Heh.. try being semi &#39;famous&#39; in a large city.  There was a time, thankfully WAY in my past, that I couldn&#39;t go to the mall, a movie, or out to eat, without running into ten people who &#39;knew&#39; me.  It was cool for a while but it turned into an ass whip pretty fast.  I really LOVE being anonymous now.  


ElBrappo     Sun Feb 4 10:07:57 2018 UTC

That&#39;s because you like your friends as a child.


Jeuscifer     Sun Feb 4 10:55:55 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t even pretend. I don&#39;t make eye contact, and just make no notice of their presence unless they want my attention. There&#39;s no need for small talk unless you want to talk to me, and I don&#39;t mind occupying my time.


kramtem     Sun Feb 4 11:00:28 2018 UTC

When you were a kid, like elementary school, did you ever run into a teacher outside of school and think &quot;what the fuck are you doing here? you only exist at school!&quot; It only happened a few times to me and I remember each one cause it screwed with my head at the time. And here&#39;s a twist as an adult. I get along really well with my wifes family that live in a little town a few hours away. I go out there often by myself to hunt and fish with her brothers and nephews. So much that I see people at the grocery store when I am by myself that I have met while with the inlaws. Then it&#39;s like &quot;what the hell now? I usually see you when I am with Eric, what the fuck do I say?&quot; 


jonysc1     Sun Feb 4 11:01:09 2018 UTC

OP sounds like a classic introvert under the belief this behavior is a result of adulthood. Interesting.


pingusbeak     Sun Feb 4 11:11:11 2018 UTC

When I was a kid my mum used to say &#39;why do I always run into people when I have greasy hair?&#39; 
Rather than pick up on that she meant &#39;just my luck to run into people when I have greasy hair!&#39;, I instead thought she was implying there was a causal relationship and grew up thinking greasy hair made you more likely to run into people. 


AccelerationGate     Sun Feb 4 11:12:02 2018 UTC

Friends? Bah, just the casual acquaintances


pnwstep     Sun Feb 4 11:12:11 2018 UTC

Had a kid ask me at the restaurant I work at on weekends if I work at their elementary school - I smiled and said yes. I couldn’t tell him how I wish the school paid me more. 


Help_im_a_potato     Sun Feb 4 11:14:45 2018 UTC

Do Americans not shop online? I’ve not done a full shop at the grocery store for about 6 years now.


cloudunknowing     Sun Feb 4 11:25:01 2018 UTC

similar but i don&#39;t remember a time when i was a kid when it felt different. i guess it&#39;s about feeling like you&#39;re wearing a mask when  you&#39;re an adult and you want some time when you don&#39;t have to wear it (and be out of the house at the same time).  i guess i always felt like i was wearing a mask. (scary.)
when do you think it shifted for you?


DontLaughItAintFunny     Sun Feb 4 11:30:33 2018 UTC

My experience is that it starts off as the usual run-of-the-mill &quot;how are you?&quot; then typically nose- dives into a penis measuring contest of how good their life is and I pretend to be excited...which I suck at doing.


snaplemouton     Sun Feb 4 11:32:11 2018 UTC

That&#39;s why you should order your groceries instead. Until you find out the delivery guy is an old friend from high school.


irisel     Sun Feb 4 11:40:46 2018 UTC

Nah, my mom ALWAYS embarrassed me in public, towards my adulthood, she normally went every in sweatpants with old dried on paint or something stupid. I don&#39;t think seeing people in public was every pleasant. 


henryuuk     Sun Feb 4 11:44:59 2018 UTC

As a Kid I hated it when my mom ran into people she knew in the stores, while I disliked running into anyone I knew when she wasn&#39;t busy cause I wouldn&#39;t be able to talk to them.  
Now I just decide how long I stay myself so now running into people I know in the city is nice


Monsignor_Gilgamesh     Sun Feb 4 11:46:41 2018 UTC

This is not true.... where did you get this from?  I still enjoy running into friends, I just don’t wanna run into someone I know that I feel obligated to stop and talk just because I know them.  This was the same when I was a kid too....


mordinxx     Sun Feb 4 12:10:41 2018 UTC

As kids we think it&#39;s cool when we run into friends at the mall or grocery store.
Unless we were with our parents.

I’m so with you on this! I just had to go to two supermarkets and I’m temporarily living in the town I grew up in (moving next week) and I see the people I knew as kids and they are so backwards it actually breaks my heart.


phoenixtwo87     Sun Feb 4 12:26:35 2018 UTC

Such is the life of the introvert. I can totally sympathize with you on this sentiment.


Ithxero     Sun Feb 4 12:31:50 2018 UTC

Is this an introvert kind of thing? Honestly curious. I personally only care about seeing people I know if it’s people I’m barely acquaintances with but even then it’s barely a whole 90 seconds out of my life. Is it that draining for some of you?

cmneiki     Sun Feb 4 12:34:32 2018 UTC

BeartimeStories     Sun Feb 4 14:46:38 2018 UTC

As a kid I still hated it cause I just want to get in get out, I don’t want any attention coming my way from other parents, now if it was a friend I’d be cool and chat it up.!


ProductofBoredom     Sun Feb 4 14:47:43 2018 UTC

This is definitely false for me, I&#39;m fine with running into people while running errands. It&#39;s just that it never happens because I live in a big city 


BloodStainedBrains     Sun Feb 4 14:53:51 2018 UTC

I was at the mall with my fiancée and ran into an old friend from high school. We both noticed each other, made eye contact, and then both decided not to say hi. It was awesome.

highly embarrassing situation- girl i used to be great friends with came up to me at a parade. naturally i had a wicked buzz going on and i was sitting there stuttering until she finally said “it’s Amanda”. i was like “oh right!”. awkward as fuck. or the time in the grocery store that someone from GRADE SCHOOL recognized me and i sat and stared at his face for a good ten seconds before i remembered i knew him. 
hence why i shop for groceries and everything else online. 
God my memory sucks. 


arrie99     Sun Feb 4 16:52:01 2018 UTC

Sincerely agree. I am the EXACT same way. If I’m at the gym I’m there to work out and get out. Same for grocery store. Same for almost all my “errand” type interaction. I, too, have a lot of friends who I adore. However don’t thrust me into the midst of a huge party or crowd....that to me is crippling.

As a question to all adults, how come you don&#39;t like running into people you know? Not 18 yet so


GregorSamsaa     Sun Feb 4 04:21:01 2018 UTC

Most adults lose themselves in the mundane aspects of day to day life. They no longer foster real friendships with people that they have things in common with.
Imagine a scenario where you’re married, have kids and work an 8-5 M-F. You have zero time to yourself at this point. Most of, if not all your interactions are associations with people from work, people from your kid’s activities or superficial acquaintances that you’ve decided to pretend you have things in common with so you can partially escape your boredom from time to time.
Now imagine you’re out doing one of the many tasks that takes up time you would rather spend doing something else and then you run into one on these people that remind you of the monotony of your life and how much you wish you could be free form it.

Are we scared of getting hurt or did we just stop caring?

Ok, let me clarify, if I see a friend, I dont mind, but if I see a person from school that i know, and they know me, and we are mere acquaintances, I pray they dont say anything.... Especially if its a girl. Because then my parents want to know who they are, what classes i have with them, is she cute........ And on and on and on.


MeGrindlok     Sun Feb 4 03:56:42 2018 UTC

I suspected this was so for many people.  It explains a lot for me.
I only know three types of people: Those that know my name by the good work I do; those I haven&#39;t met yet, but look forward to meeting like a rare gem in the rough; and those who are disturbed by my volatile nature.
The difference seems to be: I&#39;m a very social creature.  I enjoy chatting up strangers, to see what&#39;s good on the market, to hear about what work they do that we can be possibly helpful to one another and our individual causes, to find something new to watch or play, that sort of thing where being open and talkative pays huge dividends over not.
And then there&#39;s the people like what maybe OP is, that scurry around the supermarket like mice, who&#39;ll lock the door when I&#39;m around after dark, who change sides of the street because I&#39;m on it.
I don&#39;t get any gratification over being naturally disturbing to people who aren&#39;t enemies, though.  I apologize without even getting their attention first, like Canadians will apologize to light poles, &quot;Sorry!&quot; for bumping into them.  I don&#39;t mean to.  I don&#39;t want to.  I&#39;m sorry it happens.  
Individual human nature is difficult to change.  But I was anti/asocial like I suspect OP is once.  I change.  You can change.  We can all change, for better or for worse.  
<em>Not</em> or <em>refusing</em> change is the real problem we have.  We&#39;re quite a versatile and adaptable species.  Refusing your species&#39; nature is just as mentally distressing as refusing your human nature.
