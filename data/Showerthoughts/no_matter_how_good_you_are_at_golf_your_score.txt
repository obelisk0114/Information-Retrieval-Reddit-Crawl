Depends on what you mean. If by worse, you mean they&#39;re number of shots are getting higher then yes. But that&#39;s not really how scores in golf are considered. Success on a golf course is measured from the difference between the number of shots a player shoots and the number of shots it takes to shoot par. So if a player shoots a 5 on a hole with a par of 4, he would be 1 over par. Then if he shoots a 2 on a hole with a par of 3 afterwards, his score becomes even with par. Therefore, his score actually became better.

It’s a shower thought and your first sentence thoroughly explains it.
Success on a golf course is determined by having a lower score than your opponent(s). 
Par is a metric for expected shots needed to get your ball in the cup.

However, different courses have different pars. Some body shooting a 73 on a course where the par is a 68 isn&#39;t as good as somebody shooting a 75 on a course with a par of 78 even though the first score took less shots.

Since you do not understand how golf scores work here is an explanation. It also explains what par means.

Pretty sure i just explained it pretty well


SentientTeenBot     Sun Feb 4 20:50:22 2018 UTC

I mean, this would work if you said it got lower, but it&#39;s not getting worse. It&#39;s getting better


Dr_Golduck     Sun Feb 4 21:14:04 2018 UTC

Nope, every swing of the club makes your score worse.
HIGHER not lower as you commented.

not necessarily, someone could score an eagle (-3) on a hole, and his score would get better
remember score on golf isn’t measured on shots but on how lower you are on the par of the course


Dr_Golduck     Sun Feb 4 22:49:25 2018 UTC

In order to get an eagle you must swing the club, therefore, increasing your total strokes making your total higher.
At the end of the predetermined number of holes played the person with the lowest score wins. 
Here is a link to help explain.

Better compared to par and better score overall are different things.

again, the score is not counted with total strokes. I don’t need your link to learn the rules. I know how to play golf, where clearly you don’t. You count the score with your strokes less than the par. Your score is not 68/73 strokes, but it would be -5. You don’t count in total strokes. Please learn the rules before posting.
