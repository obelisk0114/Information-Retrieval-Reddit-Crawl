Because people don&#39;t want to buy cars that only go 40mph

Police department would make a fuck-ton less money if speeding tickets were no longer a thing.

They should start ticketing people for not keeping right except to pass.  They would make so much money.

Because the people paying for the cars don&#39;t mind if their own car goes fast.

Some roads have higher max speed limitsalso if some were to do it or most would, then one might simply break the standard and advertise their car&#39;s as the fastest so they could gain extra profit by doing literally nothing lol

Honestly that&#39;s a really good point. Thanks for the insight
