What else are we supposed to watch, that 3+ hour ad about football?

Confirmed. And to cry at the end.

I wouldn&#39;t say a majority. I assume you&#39;re talking about the Super Bowl. I&#39;d say most people watching are genuine football fans interested in the game and a minority are there just for the ads or halftime show, not to mention the other few billion people who aren&#39;t interesting in American football
