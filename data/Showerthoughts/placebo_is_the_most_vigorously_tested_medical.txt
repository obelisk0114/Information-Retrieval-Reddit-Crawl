Since lots of drugs have to be tested against a placebo

What is common in medical studies is to actually use a “gold standard” group.  Give one the experimental meds and the other the best, common drug for the ailment. Think about HIV. No one needs to be put on a placebo, it would kill them.  Instead give them the common drug. That’s what researchers want anyway, improvement of the current system. Practical upshot being placebo is more rare than people think
