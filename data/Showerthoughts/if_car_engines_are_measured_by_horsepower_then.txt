But then people would think boats are way more powerful than they really are<blockquote>
This boat has a massive 1,500 seahorse power engine 
Dude, that&#39;s like 1 horsepower

Seahorses I believe are incredibly weak swimmers. So you would probably have to measure it in giga seahorse power (gshp) .

Carl Sagan&#39;s motorboat has billions and billions of seahorse power.

Take my upvote, you filthy animal

I don&#39;t think anyone has ever been propelled by a seahorse....

Sea horse power would refer to the power of 10,000 seahorses which would probably be .25hp

I suggest measuring a bottlenosed dolphin’s pulling power, and referring to it as “one flipper.”
“My new outboard does 30 flp at full throttle!”
