It must&#39;ve taken more for students to get offended, too.

I started college in 97 and mostly used the internet for the early days of AIM, Quake, and reading stories at myfirsttime.com because Playboy said it was a good site.

Well there is also a lot more to know now than there was 30 years ago. They have to cram more information in the same time so I suspect it is a wash.

Huh, but it would have been easier to copy someone&#39;s work or make up citations right?
