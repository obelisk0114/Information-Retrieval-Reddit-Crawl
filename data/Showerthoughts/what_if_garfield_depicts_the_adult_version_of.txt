Then i hate how Calvin grew up. Jon is boring and a loser. And you think he would get rid of Hobbes. No way

Calvin is like six years old. It&#39;s very likely he will outgrow Hobbes. but Garfield is a nice substitute, don&#39;t you think? At least he&#39;s real.

He may not still play with Hobbes, but keeping him still and personally i like Odie better

Why a different name? Jon vs Calvin
Different parents. Jon grew up on a farm. Calvin in the suburbs. 
Just don&#39;t see it.

That&#39;s true. The theory is a bit of a stretch.

It can be fun to make stretchy theories. Or alternate universe theories.

Separated fraternal twins?

It&#39;s funny you brought this up, I actually met Bill Watterson last year. I was in Columbus to see a volleyball game -- my good friend from high school is a setter at Ohio State and this is his senior year so I finally bought the ticket out -- and while I was in town he brought me to an art exhibit the university was having. It was mostly cartoons, but there were lots of paintings of parodied sitcoms and exaggerated skylines of famous cities.
Anyways my friend is driving me up the wall by asking why there weren&#39;t any Garfield comics displayed and I noticed Bill in the corner, not looking at anything in particular but just checking his phone and peeking over his shoulder until the crowd around him died down. I think I was the only one who noticed him.
I walked over and thought about what I should say to him. I could tell he didn&#39;t want to attract a crowd but at the same time it was my only chance I would ever have to meet him. It was like meeting bigfoot. I decided to tell him about the Hobbes plush I made by hand. I know he didn&#39;t want his stuff merchandised but I thought that making Hobbes by hand and then exploring the world with him really caught the spirit of Calvin and Hobbes.
I approached Bill and told him how much he changed my outlook on what should be considered art, then he smiled and said he doesn&#39;t even consider himself an artist. Then my mouth got dry and I just felt wrong. It hit me like a ton of bricks. It wasn&#39;t Bill Watterson. Didn&#39;t even look like him.
Not one day goes by that I don&#39;t think about that man at the exhibition and how much I hate his guts.

The fuck did I just...

I prefer to think Hobbes turns into Tyler Durden and Calvin turns into the narrator from Fight Club.

I love that theory!
