Well where do you think the “red” in red lobster comes from?

Its even worse when you consider restaurants where customers pick the fish or lobster they like.

Since before I was born my family would go to the same Full House restaurant in Chinatown where they had this huge Arowana fish in a tank only big enough for it to swim in circles. I would observe it every single time in awe. Growing up it was always there swimming in circles(10+ years) and then one day it was gone and replaced by a smaller one. I was so afraid it had died or been eaten so we asked Bill the waiter about it and he said that the fish was fine and had just outgrown the tank. That it was put in a much larger one. Teenage me was suspicious but decided to believe it. Regardless I hope he eventually stopped swimming in circles:-(

The cruelty of fish tanks anywhere is actually completely wack.

Totally agree.

The Georgia Aquarium used to have a fish stick special. I always thought it was cruel.

It&#39;s no weirder than eating beef or chicken at a zoo with mammals and birds.

And if the restaurant doesn’t serve fish, they’re just some floating fish. Actually either way they’re just fish

Lambs to the slaughter. The fish doesn&#39;t know or care WTF is going on
