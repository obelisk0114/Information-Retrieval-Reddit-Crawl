Crowd funding to make ends meet is still begging.  Crowd funding to launch an idea or company or product is not. 

&quot;Give me money so I can make more money&quot;
&quot;Give me money so I can make it to the next paycheck&quot; 
I don&#39;t get why the first one is more acceptable 

The first one is also &quot;Give me money so I can make a product you want&quot;

But if there&#39;s already enough demand for it, why not speed the process along? Crowdfunding seems better for both the producer and the consumer (provided they don&#39;t just take the money and run)

startup costs are insane. You give me enough money to not die from being broke for 6 months and yeah I could create a whole lot. 

One is “give me money and I will turn it into something” and often is in return for something (I.e. Kickstarter campaigns usually provide something to backers). The other is “give me money because I’m not responsible and need someone to take care of me”. The second one I have seen people use to pay for their bills, fund a vacation, etc. it’s pathetic. 

I agree with you and all, but sometimes the first is just the second in disguise... A lot of startup projects are shady as fuck and/or a scam. But yeah! Just asking for money because they can&#39;t bother to work is plain pathetic and it&#39;s even worse when they get still get paid anyway.

Oh I’m not saying the system is perfect. Of the 15+ projects I’ve backed on Kickstarter, I’ve been straight burned by more than 5. 

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
The person asking for an investment to buy the tools to be fed for a lifetime.  The person asking to make it to the next paycheque will be hungry again.

First one is literally what all start-ups do, except rather than ask a commoner, they ask bankers/professional investors.

Because it&#39;s usually not a poor person asking for money. 

And why is that?

One is offering a product, one is not. 

Tbf, One is offering you the loss of money.

Begging means the person giving the money gets nothing back. Crowd funding is supposed to result in an actual product being made. 

supposed to

But a lot of crowdfunding is just people asking for payments (e.g for college, hospital visits, etc.) with no promise of giving anything back.

that&#39;s gofundme and that&#39;s not the majority of crowd funding. 

Yes, but that was the type of crowdfunding the OP was talking about. He&#39;s not saying all crowdfunding is begging, but a lot of it is.

Are you talking about gofundme?

Yes.

Wait, you mean that I can crowd fund a new graphics card?  

Not with Bitcoin ppl buying them all.

There’s this girl on my Facebook from high school and she puts up a go fund me for rent 3 months in a row. Then nothing for a month or two. Now she has one up for her fucking FETUS 

Fresident Ef The United States? Boy, she came far...

Now she has one up for her fucking FETUS 
I&#39;m more concerned her fetus is fucking but maybe not yourself. 

Crowd found my heroin addiction 

Maybe don&#39;t use drugs in public if you&#39;re worried about crowds finding out.

A.K.A. &quot;panhandling&quot;

Begging + technology magically makes it not begging because only poor people beg.  Poor people can&#39;t make a slick video with whimsical upbeat music, a pledge to save the world and a dodgy business plan.  In addition, if by some miracle they aren&#39;t scammers or turn out to be halfway competent, you might actually get something approximating the thing they promised.  If not, thanks a latte.  ha ha get it?  Because I spent all the money you sent us on lattes instead of actual work.  

I am financially poor mate, however, very much technically aware. After all I am on Reddit ;)I also read about some beggars who made its their occupation and earning hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some of them are even millionaires and invested in real estate. They even employ other beggars. This was from India I guess.

Street crowd funding is known as &quot;busking&quot;.

Except that “busking” generally includes a performance of some sort, and  crowdfunding does not. 

No, it isn’t. A busker doesn’t ask for money for some songs they plan on playing in the future. 

I can tell you from first hand experience, doing essentially this, but for a <em>significantly</em> different outcome, it&#39;s incredibly difficult to do, even with incredibly stupid donation rewards. 
I feel like I would get a much better return on investment if I literally just went pan handling instead of tcpipandhandling. 

When people beg for money from other people who work for their money on the internet it suddenly takes on less aggressive names, crowd funding, linking your patreon account, asking for donations on a live stream. /s 
People can decieve alot easier over the internet than someone who is honestly trying to survive on the streets when people won&#39;t hire them over the next person becuase he hasn&#39;t been employed since his job of 10 years fired him 5 years ago in a budget cut. Now his beard is nappy his clothes are tattered and his life a piece of what it was. Poeple who are too caught up with today need to realize our time on earth is finite.

I feel like this is going to be reposted on <a href="/r/LateStageCapatalism" rel="nofollow">r/LateStageCapatalism</a> soon. Mostly because it should. 

Crowd funding is begging. With a promise to do something interesting with the money. A promise they are in no way force to deliver on.

Begging digitally 

sponsoring is also just begging 

Ugh, this hits home. Due to a variety of chance factors I have fallen through the cracks and am unable to get a job at all; apparently all the douchebags on Kickstarter and GoFundMe don&#39;t understand that. Several have attacked me over my campaign to help start my YouTube channel, calling me a bum, telling me to just get a job, and saying much worse things.

(if you rely on a set of people to give you money, and your message doesn&#39;t resonate with them -- only you can change your message)

You’re dumb
