I remember when they interviewed the kids before the first movie and they said they would have to be replaced after a few years, but I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t. 


I-Hate-Hats     Sun Feb 4 05:33:09 2018 UTC

It fucked me up as a kid watching dumbledore change tho 


DataGuru314     Sun Feb 4 05:59:24 2018 UTC

Richard Harris will always be the real Dumbledore in my mind. 


dnlGreenberg003     Sun Feb 4 08:19:13 2018 UTC

Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?


Wordcraftian     Sun Feb 4 09:40:38 2018 UTC

Oh, forgive me... But I didn&#39;t quite catch that. Could you speak up, headmaster? 


MilkshakeDucks     Sun Feb 4 12:55:29 2018 UTC

asked <em>calmly</em>


andstuff13     Sun Feb 4 17:30:13 2018 UTC

The worst scene in the entire series. 
Dumbledore placed the charms himself, and then basically assaults Harry(who is largely a magical doofus up until this point) accusing him of beating those charms.
Man, I&#39;m heated now. 


Citystarrz     Sun Feb 4 19:37:43 2018 UTC

Actually, he is fully aware that an older student could have done it for him, and specifically asks if he&#39;s done this. However this is book canon, and he&#39;s much calmer in the book in this scene. This scene is one of the biggest reasons I have little to no love for Gambon as dumbledore. He completely loses his cool demeanor and you&#39;re never supposed to really see a hint of this side of him until he comes to save Harry from Barty Jr. Also, the scene when he hits Ron&#39;s leg in the hospital wing. Both very Un-Dumbledore. 


TheGreenSleaves     Sun Feb 4 20:23:30 2018 UTC

It speaks for how good the series is if that’s as bad as it gets


errolstafford     Sun Feb 4 07:53:38 2018 UTC

I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one. 


Ellovely     Sun Feb 4 23:22:43 2018 UTC

Richard Harris was the Dumbledore everyone needed at the time but not all the books had been written yet. He was perfect for the gentle Dumbledore we knew at the beginning of the series but the Dumbledore running around looking for horcruxes and getting into fights with Voldemort...I have a hard time picturing him doing all that


TimeandSpacePerson     Sun Feb 4 16:35:47 2018 UTC

I never noticed Dumbledore changed until I got older and I watched those movies a lot as a kid.


ACNLGal2016     Sun Feb 4 20:42:12 2018 UTC

Yea the original bought the farm after movie 2 and the new actor just never fit the Dumbledore role. Generic wizard? Sure. Dumbledore? no


Zabi-sama     Sun Feb 4 14:58:26 2018 UTC

For me it was the little teacher, Filius Lipetit.


its-fewer-not-less     Sun Feb 4 16:20:16 2018 UTC

TIL Flitwick&#39;s name in Finnish!


Zabi-sama     Sun Feb 4 16:25:09 2018 UTC

Haha, I always thought that Filius Lipetit was international, not Finnish :DD


Zabi-sama     Sun Feb 4 16:27:29 2018 UTC

Also Minerva McConagall is Minerva McGarmiva in Finnish.


BlackPanther01     Sun Feb 4 16:41:42 2018 UTC

Weirdly enough, it was still the same actor.


puffmaster5000     Sun Feb 4 18:50:49 2018 UTC

I honestly didn&#39;t notice until someone told me


Tobias11ize     Sun Feb 4 18:57:28 2018 UTC

I didnt even notice


monkey_trumpets     Sun Feb 4 11:24:11 2018 UTC

He was just too old. 


gleamez     Sun Feb 4 17:06:23 2018 UTC

He literally died 


arghvark     Sun Feb 4 18:15:18 2018 UTC

It&#39;s <em>especially</em> amazing that the three children they chose to be the leads at ages 10-12 or whatever they were grew up to be attractive, intelligent, and to have their lives put together well enough to handle all of it. Fame, money, pressures from the director, older actors, parents, other relatives, the public, the press, the establishment, the studio, and everyone else; imagine having to pick 3 pre-teenagers at random and bet tens of millions of dollars in investment against the chance that they would end up being the people they were at the end. 
That&#39;s the real magic of the Harry Potter movies.


Morigyn     Sun Feb 4 19:47:11 2018 UTC

I mean, Daniel Radcliffe was an alcoholic for years to deal with the pressure of it all. Apparently he has said that he can tell in which scenes he was drunk/hungover.
He’s all good now though!


DataGuru314     Sun Feb 4 05:22:32 2018 UTC

I still think it&#39;s bullshit that they fired the actor who played Crabbe right before the last movie for some trivial drug offense. 


KMnO4inyourpants     Sun Feb 4 05:44:32 2018 UTC

He was growing pot at his mom’s house. Really, I think they should have rewarded him for his independent herbology. 


HauschkasFoot     Sun Feb 4 05:45:43 2018 UTC

For real it’s not like he used magic in front of a muggle, give the guy a break


c_delta     Sun Feb 4 11:56:36 2018 UTC

You might argue that that is exactly what he did.


Seinfeldologist     Sun Feb 4 05:56:25 2018 UTC

Professor Sprout would have been proud.


TehRealZeddicus     Sun Feb 4 08:22:05 2018 UTC

He was just method acting!


Irdna     Sun Feb 4 16:06:15 2018 UTC

Should have been Nevilles actor, would have been much more Fitting.


Rhaegarion     Sun Feb 4 09:42:28 2018 UTC

People with criminal records can&#39;t work with children in the UK. Have to go through an enhanced DBS check. 


Realtrain     Sun Feb 4 17:05:41 2018 UTC

Were there many minors in the last movie though?


alienblueforgotmynom     Sun Feb 4 20:07:58 2018 UTC

There were some in the Battle of Hogwarts, which is when Crabbe appeared.


the_pun_life     Sun Feb 4 05:45:57 2018 UTC

The police arrested him and put away for a spell.


DarkDoesThings     Sun Feb 4 20:46:19 2018 UTC

Yeah, that really screwed up everything, since it meant that a character who helped keep the story moving changed.


alarbus     Sun Feb 4 05:49:16 2018 UTC

I for one would love to see a Spiderman origin story.


TheDemonHauntedWorld     Sun Feb 4 06:47:28 2018 UTC

Boy... I was so mad they didn&#39;t showed what happened to uncle Ben in Homecoming. Hope they show a flashback on the sequel. /s


its-fewer-not-less     Sun Feb 4 16:21:22 2018 UTC

And every future sequel as well-but then they change what really happened to introduce yet <em>another</em> villain 


brady2gronk     Sun Feb 4 21:13:43 2018 UTC

Hoping you&#39;re being sarcastic.


alarbus     Sun Feb 4 23:10:32 2018 UTC

Aye laddie


GingerBeerd109     Sun Feb 4 14:52:11 2018 UTC

Flitwick... That change always drove me crazy.


Faaret     Sun Feb 4 16:36:36 2018 UTC

I feel ya, but the original looked like an animatronic doll.. I think the recast gave him much more character.
edit: I should restate that, it didn&#39;t give him <em>more</em> character per say, but it did make him more &quot;real&quot; imo.


megaminxwin     Sun Feb 4 21:45:08 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not even a recast. Same actor all throughout, Warwick Davis.


Faaret     Sun Feb 4 21:48:56 2018 UTC

damn, i never knew that! i can understand why they decided to ditch the face prosthetic then. I also think he uses a slightly more normal voice in the other films.


TheReal_VidiVici     Sun Feb 4 20:28:35 2018 UTC

And this shall have a reboot too in about a decade...


thingswastaken     Sun Feb 4 11:45:34 2018 UTC

Except how Crabbe suddenly went from chubby white dude to skinny black guy


AveLucifer     Sun Feb 4 12:25:29 2018 UTC

The character Crabbe wasn&#39;t recast. The skinny black guy is Blaise Zabini, a completely separate character.


DarkDoesThings     Sun Feb 4 20:47:20 2018 UTC

Crabbe was recast because of a drug offense, but I don&#39;t remember them changing his race.


elean0rigby     Sun Feb 4 21:34:56 2018 UTC

The character wasn’t recast. They introduced a new character from the book that hadn’t been shown on screen.


Beelzebubs_Whore     Sun Feb 4 16:12:53 2018 UTC

I believe in the movie Crabbe was sent to Azkaban.


elean0rigby     Sun Feb 4 21:35:37 2018 UTC

No???


Beelzebubs_Whore     Mon Feb 5 01:07:38 2018 UTC

Yes.. that&#39;s how they explained the actor not coming back.


stardouser19     Mon Feb 5 00:04:41 2018 UTC

Speaking as to TV shows with long story arcs, and movies expected to run many year series, I wonder what it would be like if actors and actresses either wanted to stay with a role for the full 5-10 year due to artistic integrity, or, if casting directors actually made it a contract requirement to be available for X number of years.
If someone has medical problems, passes away, or in sci-fi series, is unable to deal with alien makeup (allergies, claustrophobia, etc), those things are understable.  But for me it really ruins things if a TV or movie series can&#39;t continue or switches actors and the reason is simply because the actor/actress &quot;doesn&#39;t like to do sequels&quot; or &quot;felt the character should have died after the first movie&quot; or other things of that nature.


IzarkKiaTarj     Sun Feb 4 19:54:54 2018 UTC

I once made a chart of each character in the film, whether they had the same actor throughout the series, and who the different actors were.
Edit: I just noticed that I submitted the comment without finishing my train of thought. Anyway, I was surprised by how many of them remained the same. I also found out that Sean Biggerstaff returned in DH2 for a five-second cameo during the Battle of Hogwarts.


Chummmp     Sun Feb 4 20:39:01 2018 UTC

Cool


mazotori     Sun Feb 4 23:08:25 2018 UTC

Do you still have it?


IzarkKiaTarj     Sun Feb 4 23:46:24 2018 UTC

Yeah, but it&#39;s only accessible via the &quot;entire computer backup&quot; on my external hard drive because my laptop&#39;s being repaired.
They said it should only be a couple more days, but they also told me four and a half weeks ago that it&#39;d be about two or three weeks, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I can post it when I get it back. And since I know I&#39;m going to forget:
RemindMe! 1 week &quot;Harry Potter Cast table&quot;


Summamabitch     Sun Feb 4 14:24:32 2018 UTC

Having the same cast during the duration of those movies has nothing to do with a rebooted series. 


ensiform     Sun Feb 4 16:29:57 2018 UTC

The plural of series is series. Don’t add an apostrophe. 


adamcoe     Sun Feb 4 09:47:16 2018 UTC

It&#39;s amazing the Harry Potter series was completed with people still thinking it&#39;s OK that grown adults are into children&#39;s books


DavyWolf     Sun Feb 4 14:21:04 2018 UTC

Many people who grew up with the books are now adults. It&#39;s normal to appreciate something that was a part of your childhood later in life.


fiddleaffig     Sun Feb 4 12:48:24 2018 UTC

Who hurt you?


spydercrystal     Sun Feb 4 17:15:05 2018 UTC

They stop being “kids books” at Goblet of Fire. The fact that people continued to think of them as “kids books” and not maturing toward adulthood in depth and tone along with the main protagonists’ coming-of-age is how we got the shitshow of a movie that was OotP and the frantic scramble of the last three movies to make sure they got the most important bits in, yet still missed fundamental aspects of their characters because they were trying to make sure little kids weren’t thinking too hard about hostile government takeover and youthful rebellion. 


elanhilation     Sun Feb 4 12:51:44 2018 UTC

I think it’s amazing that someone could believe an entertaining piece of pop culture can be suitable one year and then aged out of the next. You must be very insecure about your own maturity, to think like that. 


everyoneLikesPizza     Sun Feb 4 22:43:57 2018 UTC

There&#39;s nothing wrong with finding enjoyment or meaning in simple stories. Fables are basically the only form of entertainment/moral exploration humans had for thousands of years so it&#39;s kind of built into us. Not everything has to be Crime and Punishment. 


ZXLXXXI     Sun Feb 4 11:12:21 2018 UTC

I think people forget that adults didn&#39;t read children&#39;s books before HP.


Unravled_Industries     Sun Feb 4 13:46:47 2018 UTC

Dude, I&#39;m an adult and if the book is well written then I&#39;m going to read it. Heck lots of adults read children&#39;s books to their children and grandchildren. 


ZXLXXXI     Sun Feb 4 17:17:49 2018 UTC

Yes, but adults buying and reading children&#39;s books for themselves wasn&#39;t a big thing before HP.


rego137     Sun Feb 4 18:55:57 2018 UTC

The hobbit was a children&#39;s book and plenty of adults read that


ZXLXXXI     Sun Feb 4 19:32:59 2018 UTC

True - though it was part of a series of four books the other three of which are usually considered adult. Of course adults have always read kids books, but I think HP popularized the practice.


maxman1313     Sun Feb 4 15:30:07 2018 UTC

Then who writes/edits/promotes the books?
