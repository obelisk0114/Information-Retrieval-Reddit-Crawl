It fucked me up as a kid watching dumbledore change tho 

Richard Harris will always be the real Dumbledore in my mind. 

Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?

Oh, forgive me... But I didn&#39;t quite catch that. Could you speak up, headmaster? 

asked <em>calmly</em>

I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one. 

He was just too old. 

I remember when they interviewed the kids before the first movie and they said they would have to be replaced after a few years, but I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t. 

I still think it&#39;s bullshit that they fired the actor who played Crabbe right before the last movie for some trivial drug offense. 

He was growing pot at his mom’s house. Really, I think they should have rewarded him for his independent herbology. 

For real it’s not like he used magic in front of a muggle, give the guy a break

You might argue that that is exactly what he did.

Professor Sprout would have been proud.

He was just method acting!

People with criminal records can&#39;t work with children in the UK. Have to go through an enhanced DBS check. 

The police arrested him and put away for a spell.

I for one would love to see a Spiderman origin story.

Boy... I was so mad they didn&#39;t showed what happened to uncle Ben in Homecoming. Hope they show a flashback on the sequel. /s

Except how Crabbe suddenly went from chubby white dude to skinny black guy

The character Crabbe wasn&#39;t recast. The skinny black guy is Blaise Zabini, a completely separate character.

It&#39;s amazing the Harry Potter series was completed with people still thinking it&#39;s OK that grown adults are into children&#39;s books

Who hurt you?

I think it’s amazing that someone could believe an entertaining piece of pop culture can be suitable one year and then aged out of the next. You must be very insecure about your own maturity, to think like that. 

I think people forget that adults didn&#39;t read children&#39;s books before HP.

Dude, I&#39;m an adult and if the book is well written then I&#39;m going to read it. Heck lots of adults read children&#39;s books to their children and grandchildren.
