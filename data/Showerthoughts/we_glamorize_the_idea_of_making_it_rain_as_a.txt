“Making it sunny” doesn’t have the same ring to it, I guess.

Mmm. Da club is where it&#39;s at.
Sometimes, when there are attractive dudes there, they&#39;ll it&#39;s raining men too.
Idioms about rain, in general, are pretty interesting, and seem to vary on the spectrum of positive to negative:<ul><li>Raining on one&#39;s parade</li><li>Raining cats and dogs</li><li>Right as rain</li><li>Saving something for a rainy day</li><li>Hillary Duff and they lyrics to &quot;Come Clean&quot;</li></ul>
Etymologically, though, the &quot;rainmaker&quot; idea makes sense. In agrarian societies, there was a great deal of economic value in bringing rain to fall on the crops.
