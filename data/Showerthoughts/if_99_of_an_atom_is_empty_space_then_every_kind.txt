Thus I have many brain cells, they simply don&#39;t amount to much.

Have you read &#39;men who stare at goats&#39;? The US army actually tried to create a group of super soldiers that could run through walls by aligning the gaps in their atoms- it didn&#39;t work obviously. Also, they tried stopping a goats heart by staring at it, and becoming invisible.
