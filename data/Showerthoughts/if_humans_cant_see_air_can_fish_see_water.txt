Yes, just like we see water when we dive in a pool let&#39;s say. If you took a fish out of water they would not see air.

Probably, but since theyre completely surrounded by it, they probably dont notice it

My guess is what water looks like to us when we look down at a lake say, is what they see the lack of water when they look up so they don&#39;t see what they&#39;re surrounded in anymore so air looks like water to them in a sense. They just don&#39;t name it. I have this little fish at my job and he always comes to the top and will stick his mouth out and open it, it probably sees me and thinks I&#39;m going to give him food but he&#39;s cute and has personality

Well you can&#39;t really see water.  What you see is the effect of the light refracting off the surface.  Your eyes are designed to work in the air, so without goggles, you can&#39;t see as a fish might see.
