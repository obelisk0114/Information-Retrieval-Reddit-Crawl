I’m sure elementary teachers would prefer <a href="https://youtu.be/AF_nfazQaek" rel="nofollow">this nap time</a>, though.

When you’re young, you sleep a lot. When you’re old, you want to sleep a lot but never have the time. When you’re an adolescent, you sleep whenever you want because you don’t gaf.

Nap time is always useful

There already is nap time in high school. It&#39;s called class.
