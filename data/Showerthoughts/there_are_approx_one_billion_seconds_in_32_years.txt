You don&#39;t become a billionaire from a job.


new_abcdefghijkl     Sun Feb 4 11:29:08 2018 UTC

You become a billionaire by generations of luck on the stock market 


wastley     Sun Feb 4 03:07:07 2018 UTC

Also you would need no expenses


1_2_um_12     Sun Feb 4 03:47:43 2018 UTC

I imagine if you&#39;re working 24/7 you&#39;ll have no expenses. 


Neegrodomis     Sun Feb 4 10:18:56 2018 UTC

meth is expensive man


braille_animalia     Sun Feb 4 03:49:00 2018 UTC

And no taxes.


charklar     Sun Feb 4 04:06:00 2018 UTC

Or.....you can come up with a way to get 3,600 people to work for you for $1 an hour for 32 years while charging $2 an hour for your service.

Really puts it in perspective how much money billionaires make


hopefulbromantic     Sun Feb 4 06:37:44 2018 UTC

TIL I’m approximately one billion seconds year old. 


rllynowhuh     Sun Feb 4 10:43:13 2018 UTC

Technically you&#39;re one billion seconds old. You don&#39;t need the &quot;years&quot; anymore. 


TheLeopardColony     Sun Feb 4 03:31:24 2018 UTC

You just need a small loan from your father.


Pixielay     Sun Feb 4 07:10:14 2018 UTC

Without eating, sleeping, and without taxes


ArtbyAtlas0     Sun Feb 4 07:10:02 2018 UTC

This reminds me of that one song...
&quot;I’m Semi, I stay automatic
Money, Add Then Multiply,
I call that mathe-mathematics&quot;


PM_ME_STEAMGAMES_PLS     Sun Feb 4 13:45:46 2018 UTC

Hire 2 people at $1,800 an hour each, keep the rest.


ToastedCheezer     Sun Feb 4 18:31:42 2018 UTC

Or go into politics and scam everybody!


charreddit     Sun Feb 4 07:32:09 2018 UTC

The only way to get rich is by taking advantage of other people.


karakota     Sun Feb 4 15:12:08 2018 UTC

Ponzi scheme


Loki_The_Trixter     Sun Feb 4 23:09:06 2018 UTC

First, that&#39;s not true.
Second, rich is a relative term.
Third, if you make 30k USD/year or more then you are the 1% of the world.


TimorousCharles     Sun Feb 4 04:07:12 2018 UTC

You forgot taxes


Phanta5mag0ria     Sun Feb 4 18:21:45 2018 UTC

Have you got a calculator in your shower? 


Osami100     Sun Feb 4 05:08:13 2018 UTC

I assume most billionares don&#39;t have a billion in their personal bank account. They either own a company that is worth that much or inherited it from someone who made a company worth that much. You don&#39;t really become a billionare with a regular job.


Loki_The_Trixter     Sun Feb 4 23:12:49 2018 UTC

IDK why most people don&#39;t understand this. If your a billionaire you don&#39;t leave 1 billion in a bank account earning .5% interest. You invest it in buying more companies(or stocks), or investing in your current company in the hopes of increasing your companies profits.


satinism     Sun Feb 4 03:18:27 2018 UTC

Nah bruh... crypto...


1_2_um_12     Sun Feb 4 03:54:42 2018 UTC

Lemme see, move the decimal point, carry the one, multiply by two..  
Confirmed: I helped pay for the tesseract portrayed in the documentary Interstellar.
