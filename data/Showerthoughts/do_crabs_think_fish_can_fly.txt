Please stop being such a blatant thief. Your kind aren&#39;t wanted here.

I thought it had probably been posted before to be fair, but I genuinely came across this for the first time today and it actually made me stop and think :) feel free to downvote, I just wanted to share


Reposter_Roaster     Sun Feb 4 21:45:14 2018 UTC

but I genuinely came across this for the first time today and it actually made me stop and think &quot;Wow, I should tell people I came up with this and spam it so people know I&#39;m quite a lazy thief&quot; :)
Alright, calm down son. 


d3v01d23     Sun Feb 4 22:01:58 2018 UTC

Okay. Why do you waste your time doing things like this btw? I could understand if it was just my post, but it seems to be your mission to do this. Have you not got anything productive to be getting on with instead?


DrunkenShitposter     Sun Feb 4 21:41:21 2018 UTC

No; they can swim just like fish can. In fact, the full name of the blue crab means &#39;beautiful swimmwer.&#39;


d3v01d23     Sun Feb 4 22:00:47 2018 UTC

Interesting :) I&#39;ve seen crabs kind of dog paddle, but eventually just sink


ITSYABOYJOLIEOLIE     Sun Feb 4 22:10:35 2018 UTC

Crabs can swim as well... Can they not? 


d3v01d23     Sun Feb 4 22:14:04 2018 UTC

Apparently so, according to another comment. Guess I need to research my marine life a bit better


ITSYABOYJOLIEOLIE     Sun Feb 4 22:14:54 2018 UTC

If it&#39;s any consolation I don&#39;t think you deserve the shit people are giving you.


d3v01d23     Sun Feb 4 22:52:59 2018 UTC

Oh I don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s to be expected with these kinds of popular subs :) I genuinely just thought it was an interesting thought


Battlefield_legend13     Sun Feb 4 21:17:28 2018 UTC

Hahahaha


Reposter_Roaster     Sun Feb 4 21:18:22 2018 UTC

Don&#39;t encourage the thief.
