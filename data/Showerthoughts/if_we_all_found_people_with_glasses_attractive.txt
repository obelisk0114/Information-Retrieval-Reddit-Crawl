61% of the American population reported wearing glasses or having bad eyesight in 2012. It’s already happening.

I don’t think it’s due to genetic breeding though, it’s probably all the time people in general spend looking at screens

That’s not how that works ...

Their bad eyesight isn&#39;t due to genes though. It&#39;s like if there was some massively popular sport that had a high chance of breaking your arm. That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re selecting for people with broken arms.

I know this was going to happen but I couldn&#39;t be fucked to change the limbs

Aka the sexy librarian/teacher effect

I think reverse psychology is at the base of that. We see glasses as an ugly trait, so an attractive woman with glasses must be really attractive then.
