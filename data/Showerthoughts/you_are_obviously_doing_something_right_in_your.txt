Do you even understand the concept of time travel?


bluemoe     Sun Feb 4 17:25:20 2018 UTC

On your current timeline you’ve never been visited by someone from the future.  You have no memory or experiences to change your current timeline and decision making process. However, if you had been visited you would be on a different timeline with different outcomes from your previous timeline.  
In a different parallel universe you could have been visited by your future self which would put you on a completely different path. But so far that hasn’t happened so you are on the path with no outside influences. 
But tomorrow you could be put on a different path.

The way I understand it, using time travel to change anything is paradoxical, if it is changed then once the time comes around there is no reason to go back, therefore erasing the change ever being made.

But at the time your future self goes back in time they are on your current timeline. They are set to change something they know to change to avoid something bad (in their eyes). Which would then set you on a new path.  In the future that bad thing would most likely be gone but you’d be on a completely new timeline.

Because of my current lack of activity my future self is too broke to afford a time machine.

I think my future self is still saving up money to buy that ride cause there is plenty he could tell me to avoid. :)

They already came and replaced me because I am going to be disabled, but I have a job to do that is vital to the safety of the world.

That&#39;s not correct because if I die of old age before time travel is invented then how I&#39;m doing in life is irrelevant.

Got kids?

In the future, time travel causes so many issues that practically immediately after its invention, it is outlawed.
So the only way you would ever encounter your future self, is if you are employed as a looper, and your loop is closed.

future self can’t afford the time jump subway cuz you so broke
