&quot;pause the game&quot; isn&#39;t so much of ignorance, more so a polite way for your parents to say &quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck, stop playing.&quot;


Naditzu     Sun Feb 4 16:05:33 2018 UTC

I feel like a lot of those same parents wouldn&#39;t pause their TV even though it&#39;s way more likely to be possible.


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 16:56:07 2018 UTC

Why should they have to? It&#39;s their house, their tv, and the kid has the luxury of getting to use them all for free. Kinda strange to suggest that they should have to pause anything at the demand of their child dont you think?

It&#39;s their house, their tv, and the kid has the luxury of getting to use them all for free.
Y&#39;know, I wouldn&#39;t take that deal. I mean, sure, if someone offered to let me stay at their house and play on their console, for free, that&#39;d sound amazing, and I&#39;d do my best to pull my weight in house chores.
But if they turned out to be a petty authoritarian, and they thought themselves entitled to yell at me if I didn&#39;t drop everything else to do chores at the exact minute they want, I&#39;d leave. I&#39;d do odd jobs, move to a cheap dingy flat, eat a lot of potatoes, and leave the heat off as much as possible to save on bills. I&#39;ve done that and it&#39;s light years better than living with luxuries but no freedom.
Kids don&#39;t have that option. No money or employable skills, no skills to get by on their own, can&#39;t legally work or rent or even move out.


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 18:43:25 2018 UTC

What you&#39;d do is youd pay rent because I&#39;m assuming youre an adult. Part of that involves giving up a portion of your hard earned cash promptly, now and not later, at the time that rhe land lord says it is due as well as following a strict set of rules associated with using their space. When parents make demands it is to teach kids how to deal with authority, i.e. your boss making a demand of you expecting you not to go, &quot;gawd just give me 5 minutes man! I&#39;m in the middle of a game.&quot;


JeremySmokedham     Sun Feb 4 19:56:01 2018 UTC

at the time that rhe land lord says it is due
Well, no. At the time that the lease says it&#39;s due, which I know in advance. Not any time the landlord feels like barging in and demanding money.<blockquote>
following a strict set of rules associated with using their space
Not all that strict, and there&#39;s sharp legal limits on how strict they can be. And if the landlord wants to make it stricter than I want (perhaps I want to hang things on the wall, or get pets), then I can move out. The police won&#39;t chase me down and return me to my old flat.<blockquote>
When parents make demands it is to teach kids how to deal with authority
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. Observing parents in real life, it doesn&#39;t seem to involve any intent to teach.
It&#39;s sometimes about necessity: if the dustman&#39;s about to come, then yes, you need to take out the trash now. That&#39;s obviously legitimate and parents should teach their children that it&#39;s important.
It&#39;s often about convenience: the parent just doesn&#39;t want to have the trash around for 10 more minutes, or to risk having to remind the child again if they forget. It&#39;s certainly reasonable to make requests of another person for your own convenience. But parents very easily slip into assuming that their own desires are everything, and their child&#39;s don&#39;t matter at all. This isn&#39;t deliberate, it&#39;s just the natural consequence of any person having power over another.
And... yeah, sometimes it&#39;s kind of about the power trip. An idea that goes &quot;This person <em>belongs</em> to me, they <em>must</em> do what I want, and if they disobey they <em>must</em> be struck down.&quot; Of course in a super-low-stakes situation like this, it&#39;s harmless. But it&#39;s not exactly an attitude you wanna encourage.<blockquote>
your boss making a demand of you expecting you not to go, &quot;gawd just give me 5 minutes man! I&#39;m in the middle of a game.&quot;
I&#39;ve actually seen that happen! My boss gave instructions to my coworker while he was playing Hearthstone on lunch break. The coworker said &quot;Sure, lemme just wrap up that game.&quot;
And, again, I&#39;m free to quit. I can look for a better job, or if it&#39;s too bad even just quit and hope something turns up before my savings run out. I can absolutely refuse to have a boss, and go freelance. I can join a hippie commune.
I think you&#39;re really not realising how <em>trapped</em> children are. If your parents are disrespectful and unkind, well, you&#39;re gonna live with disrespectful and unkind people who tell you what to do, until you&#39;re 18. (And possibly longer, if you didn&#39;t have the opportunity to earn much money.)


mass_shadow     Sun Feb 4 23:28:30 2018 UTC

Currently 17 and can confirm that I have had fantasies of moving out into my own place. Happiness, in this case, is a balance between Freedom and Security, and while parents offer lots if security, your freedoms can suffer because of it


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 23:51:02 2018 UTC

It&#39;s literally just a videogame, if your character dies in the two seconds you are gone nobody gives a shit. Also chores are typically set in advance which is exactly why I used the example of the land lord and rent i.e. mow the lawn every sunday. There are also consequences to breaking your lease by the way. I think you&#39;re also forgetting how spoiled and bratty kids become when their parents leave them to do what ever they want or let them disrespect them. I&#39;ve watched grown adults back talk their bosses and say things like &quot;then fire me&quot; when told to do something they didn&#39;t want to do. The first thing I always think is that their parents didn&#39;t tell them no enough. Starts with things like this. Itndoesnt just include things like taking out the trash, there&#39;s also things like doing your homework which if theyre telling you to get it done it isn&#39;t usually because you have a ton of time left to do it. 


TronX33     Sun Feb 4 19:49:21 2018 UTC

Because a kid playing video games in their free time is totally the same as an adult playing games when they&#39;re supposed to be doing a job that they are being paid to do.


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 23:38:30 2018 UTC

The former is a learning experience to get a person ready for the latter. 


Naditzu     Sun Feb 4 17:27:17 2018 UTC

Also just as ludicrous for a parent to demand a kid quit their game (for non-emergency) at that exact moment when they could finish up what they&#39;re doing and then do it.


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 17:35:11 2018 UTC

No, it isn&#39;t. The parents give way more than the kid does in order to give the kid the life that they have and to allow them to have the tools they need to grow up. Part of that is learning that you&#39;re going to have to do things that you don&#39;t want to from time to time. The least you can do is take out the trash now and not later. You did cost them an insane amount of money after all. And I&#39;m pretty sure you (hypothetical child) didn&#39;t even pay for that console you&#39;re using anyways. 


Naditzu     Sun Feb 4 17:50:32 2018 UTC

Ok. So by your logic regardless of if you live with your parents or not you HAVE to drop everything you&#39;re doing ever because you owe them 18 years of payment and your life. I can guarantee 90% of adults don&#39;t take orders from their parents.
It makes way more sense to me that if I say to my kid &quot;Can you take the garbage out?&quot; and them reply &quot;Yeah, ok just give me 10 minutes&quot; and be ok with that because it&#39;s a perfectly fine compromise. As opposed to the &quot;I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re doing or what&#39;s important to you right now! I gave you life and pay your bills so fuck you&quot; card lol I&#39;ve met people with parents like that and as adults they have a very hard time in my opinion doing anything without being told and are usually afraid of authority. 


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 18:36:30 2018 UTC

Ok. So by your logic regardless of if you live with your parents or not
Let me stop you right there cathy newman. The premise of the conversation is clearly a kid who still lives with their parents. I even went so far as to state that they are using their parents house as well as their tv and console that they didnt pay for (assuming it was gifted).<blockquote>
&quot;I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re doing or what&#39;s important to you right now! I gave you life and pay your bills so fuck you&quot; card
That isn&#39;t what it is at all. It&#39;s actually teaching a human being how to go out in the world and be able to respectfully handle authority relationships which is an extremely desireable trait in employees. 
I&#39;m starting to think you&#39;re coming from the place of a resentful teenager.


gargebarbage     Sun Feb 4 18:51:04 2018 UTC

sounds like u might have a resentful teenager


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 18:54:02 2018 UTC

I have no kids, just empathy for parents. Including my own. I didn&#39;t understand them either when I was your age. Then I grew up and it made more sense and I actually found myself wishing they were harder on me. 


gargebarbage     Sun Feb 4 19:11:59 2018 UTC

my age? lol


Naditzu     Sun Feb 4 19:11:36 2018 UTC

The thing is all your saying is it&#39;s &quot;teaching them to listen/obey&quot; which you&#39;re right is a desirable trait in employees. What I&#39;m saying is a lot of people I&#39;ve known and met who come from the type of household where it&#39;s &quot;you do what I say and do it now. No discussion&quot; either can&#39;t make choices themselves in real life (because they&#39;re always being told what to do) or completely rebel against authority (like my 30 year old rebellious teenage self apparently lol), or are terrified not to listen and please authority blindly (out of fear of retaliation).
I know not every case ends up that way and it&#39;s possible to grow out of it. The issue here is you seem to think I&#39;m saying a parent should never do that and I&#39;m not because sometimes there is a reason a kid (especially depending on age) just won&#39;t get it and reasoning why you need something done immediately would be hard. I&#39;m talking about how as time goes on parents needs to ease up on those ultimatums and let a kid make their own choices and deal with the consequences.
If they say in 15 minutes and never do it (especially if it&#39;s a trend) then take away that game since as you stated it&#39;s equivalent to their pay for doing their job. Then you gave them the chance and taught them the consequence of not doing your job.  


SomeDude9992     Sun Feb 4 19:15:28 2018 UTC

or completely rebel against authority (like my 30 year old rebellious teenage self apparently lol)
They may be able to say a lot of things about you, but they cant say you&#39;re not a good sport. That actually got a laugh out of me. 


Gig472     Sun Feb 4 22:56:04 2018 UTC

Agreed. I&#39;m a gamer, but &quot;I can&#39;t pause&quot; isn&#39;t an excuse to not do things in real life that actually matter. Just die in the game and go take out the damn trash like you should have done before you started playing.


TronX33     Mon Feb 5 00:24:52 2018 UTC

And sometimes people are only told to do something after they start. Its not an excuse to not do things, its to postpone that a few minutes.


Gig472     Mon Feb 5 00:44:50 2018 UTC

That&#39;s obviously a different story and not at all what I was talking about. My point before you began putting words in my mouth was that real life obligations always come before playing a game.
