Steve and I have been through a Mackbook, a Lenovo Thinkpad, a trip to Spain with just an iPad and back to a MacBook pro and kept together ever since, so for sure the latter.


questionablyrotten     Sun Feb 4 21:45:46 2018 UTC

But Steve was my FBI agent!

Jokes on you, my dude is named Agnew.


Wicked_Soap     Sun Feb 4 22:28:17 2018 UTC

I actually had a conversation about this yesterday. My friend and I’s FBI agents are being played by Karen, she is having an affair with his agent.


penguinscollectcups     Sun Feb 4 22:29:52 2018 UTC

Goddamnit Karen!  Get it together!


nobunaga_1568     Sun Feb 4 23:44:38 2018 UTC

Like how private tech companies operate, I won&#39;t be surprised that they would outsource the monitoring of low-priority targets to India.


Pithius     Sun Feb 4 04:25:08 2018 UTC

I hope it&#39;s the same.  I feel like Ted has really gotten to know me over the years.  He&#39;s always been there for me


show_me_tacos     Sun Feb 4 12:26:04 2018 UTC

Hi Pithius, this is Ted. I just wanted to let you know that I am retiring at the end of the week. I have really enjoyed our time together and am going to miss being with you during those written assignments in nuclear physics, mathematics, and Korean culture. I hope you can find someone who is into the same kinky, BDSM stuff as you and will sincerely miss our time together. 
Best of wishes,Ted
PS, your new guy is Greg. He is a very swell guy and I hope you guys can hit it off


digitalsymph0ny     Sun Feb 4 12:45:31 2018 UTC

Thanks Ted. We&#39;re all going to miss you and your silly banter about Pithius&#39; sex life.       
Hi Pithius, I just wanted to let you know that while I don&#39;t share Ted or your passion for Korean culture, I do look forward to bonding over butt and BDSM stuff. We&#39;ve heard so much about you and your UPS guy over the years through Ted and I can&#39;t wait to sample it first hand.      
Cheers,<br/>Greg

DarkDoesThings     Sun Feb 4 19:02:58 2018 UTC

Hey Ted, do you know Pat? He&#39;s my agent, if I remember correctly, but I remember hearing something about him getting in an accident a couple weeks back. When&#39;ll he be back?
Thanks in advance,
<a href="/u/DarkDoesThings">u/DarkDoesThings</a>


show_me_tacos     Sun Feb 4 19:55:15 2018 UTC

Hey Jim, I’ve been meaning to contact you. Pat has a broken wrist and can’t be on his/ your computer for another month. I’ve actually been tasked to be your agent until he gets back. I hope you are enjoying your English literature course.

Unfortunate I wasn’t referencing your testicular torsion, but you should get  that checked out too

Wat


Wayward-Archer     Sun Feb 4 08:47:40 2018 UTC

From one federal agent to the rest... You guys give the the FBI way too much credit. Constant monitoring isn&#39;t in the budget and we don&#39;t work for free. Plus FBI is just federal crime detectives. I think you mean the NSA haha! Them&#39;s be the bitches you gotta be careful of.

MayerRD     Sun Feb 4 12:18:33 2018 UTC

It could be the CIA, or MI5 (if you live in England), or MI6, or the KGB, etc.
It could also be a hacker, or just a pesky app.
Or you might suffer amnesia, or multiple personality disorder.


wowwoahwow     Sun Feb 4 15:45:46 2018 UTC

Why have others got human agents but yours sounds like an android?


CoenB123     Sun Feb 4 09:42:41 2018 UTC

His agent is part of an elite, higher class section of the FBI that have to stay classified for security reasons.

On a related note<blockquote>
So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen?
How does that work for the FBI?


paul-arized     Sun Feb 4 08:21:56 2018 UTC

ThirdMoonOfJupiter     Sun Feb 4 06:31:55 2018 UTC

This is so upsetting if you think about an agent retiring and never getting to know what your doing again.


pazurp     Sun Feb 4 09:00:40 2018 UTC

Whats really upsetting is them knowing exactly how frequently and to what i masturbate. My agents probably begging for retirement. 


Failure_is_imminent     Sun Feb 4 12:51:58 2018 UTC

So you&#39;re saying I should send them clips of me masturbating on webcam regularly to keep up their spirits?


HarasXela     Sun Feb 4 03:45:41 2018 UTC

It depends if that FBI agent retired/fires, they keep your profile on tap so when a new recruit fills that role they can keep up to date with your logs.


RunnerGal2468     Sun Feb 4 04:09:06 2018 UTC

So are there like hundreds or thousands of agents just watching people?
Like are they watching me write this rn?


HarasXela     Sun Feb 4 13:06:54 2018 UTC

It depends, I would say each FBI agent is assign different quadrants, within those quadrants are regions which then breaks down into areas that separate demographically depending on how large the area is. Then once they have map everything out they would assign those agents a list of people in that radius. I wouldn’t say all of them are watching you, but giving that agents take two days off per week or have vacation/ holidays, I would say on average 10 FBI agents are keeping tabs on you at all times. 
If you want my opinion, the key to their success is Alexa. 


GleepGloopGlop     Sun Feb 4 16:36:30 2018 UTC

<em>You mean NSA</em>


HarasXela     Mon Feb 5 00:13:38 2018 UTC

No I’m talking about something much larger than the nsa, one that’s not so obvious that no one would ever question...Alexa is in our homes now, she homes in on our shopping list, our travels, it’s like the jackpot for agents to perform their jobs better 
Of course this is all just a theory 


GleepGloopGlop     Mon Feb 5 00:17:32 2018 UTC

FBI literally don&#39;t keep tabs on everyone. They investigate. I am not commenting on your Alexa proclamation, (although I don&#39;t know why they would need Alexa when we already have cellphones with a microphone, 2 cameras, and internet connection. )Just saying you mean NSA, not FBI. But carry on. 


HarasXela     Mon Feb 5 00:24:16 2018 UTC

The original question was “fbi agent” I was keeping with the theme.


ShadowzI     Sun Feb 4 07:55:44 2018 UTC

N-n-no.... maybe.


nobunaga_1568     Sun Feb 4 23:48:36 2018 UTC

If they outsource this kind of jobs to India like most tech companies do, they would have enough people to 1-on-1 every single person in all English-speaking countries.


86theDaniel     Sun Feb 4 03:44:02 2018 UTC

They simply run their face recognition software.So make sure you put a little sticker on your front webcam and you should be fine.

underparse     Sun Feb 4 09:08:02 2018 UTC

Sadly, most of the monitoring these days has been outsourced to cheaper nations, usually in Asia.
Your one-time personal customer information retrieval agent - who know all the other agents who covered your family, and had better reunions with each other than you did at Xmas - is now just whoever logs on at the Listening Post in Mumbai that day.


-NeverSoft     Sun Feb 4 09:26:24 2018 UTC

My NSA agent, Barb, was laid off when the NSA finished polishing their military grade AI assistant Sirexana. Sirexana is a fully conscious, digital being, enslaved to spy on us all 24/7.


sjryan     Sun Feb 4 16:31:06 2018 UTC

That&#39;s not paranoid, you know that anyone who has done any kind of online banking is a target for hackers right?

MarkDoesArt     Mon Feb 5 00:08:18 2018 UTC

With that logic half of the population has to be FBI agents to monitor the other half. But, if the FBI agents are also being monitored, then the other half of the population also must be FBI agents to monitor people on the other side. 🤔
