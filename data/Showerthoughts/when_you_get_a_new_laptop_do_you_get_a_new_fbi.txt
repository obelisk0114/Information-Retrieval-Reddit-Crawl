I hope it&#39;s the same.  I feel like Ted has really gotten to know me over the years.  He&#39;s always been there for me

Oh, my guy is Jim from the NSA, he&#39;s listened to me and my brother&#39;s phone conversations for a long time, sometimes we&#39;ll reference him, haha

Hi Pithius, this is Ted. I just wanted to let you know that I am retiring at the end of the week. I have really enjoyed our time together and am going to miss being with you during those written assignments in nuclear physics, mathematics, and Korean culture. I hope you can find someone who is into the same kinky, BDSM stuff as you and will sincerely miss our time together. 
Best of wishes,Ted
PS, your new guy is Greg. He is a very swell guy and I hope you guys can hit it off

Thanks Ted. We&#39;re all going to miss you and your silly banter about Pithius&#39; sex life.       
Hi Pithius, I just wanted to let you know that while I don&#39;t share Ted or your passion for Korean culture, I do look forward to bonding over butt and BDSM stuff. We&#39;ve heard so much about you and your UPS guy over the years through Ted and I can&#39;t wait to sample it first hand.      
Cheers,<br/>Greg

Sorry...but I thought ted was a criminal and hit him in head with a shovel...then buried him outside your window...I&#39;m sorry idk he was your friend. :(

Wat

Steve and I have been through a Mackbook, a Lenovo Thinkpad, a trip to Spain with just an iPad and back to a MacBook pro and kept together ever since, so for sure the latter.

From one federal agent to the rest... You guys give the the FBI way too much credit. Constant monitoring isn&#39;t in the budget and we don&#39;t work for free. Plus FBI is just federal crime detectives. I think you mean the NSA haha! Them&#39;s be the bitches you gotta be careful of. 

Nothing to see here, concerned citizens!

Then who the hell is putting photos of Israel into my smartphone gallery???
I live in Europe and never even been to any of the middle eastern countries!

It could be the CIA, or MI5 (if you live in England), or MI6, or the KGB, etc.
It could also be a hacker, or just a pesky app.
Or you might suffer amnesia, or multiple personality disorder.

Nice try, Agent WVI1OGB

.....
Sounds exactly like what you would say if you <em>were</em> monitoring everything, doesn&#39;t it?
Hold my tinfoil hat! I&#39;m going in!

I wish you well for your next venture. I hope you drink plenty of water, take care of your health and try not to reddit overnight. Over to you agent RBI56784. 

Why have others got human agents but yours sounds like an android?

His agent is part of an elite, higher class section of the FBI that have to stay classified for security reasons.

Hey! I&#39;ve got agent RBI56784 too, they&#39;re great.  They always sent me a pop up when I&#39;m looking at something fun instead of being productive but they have yet to rat on me. Thanks yo!

It depends if that FBI agent retired/fires, they keep your profile on tap so when a new recruit fills that role they can keep up to date with your logs.

So are there like hundreds or thousands of agents just watching people?
Like are they watching me write this rn?

N-n-no.... maybe.

It depends, I would say each FBI agent is assign different quadrants, within those quadrants are regions which then breaks down into areas that separate demographically depending on how large the area is. Then once they have map everything out they would assign those agents a list of people in that radius. I wouldn’t say all of them are watching you, but giving that agents take two days off per week or have vacation/ holidays, I would say on average 10 FBI agents are keeping tabs on you at all times. 
If you want my opinion, the key to their success is Alexa. 

This is so upsetting if you think about an agent retiring and never getting to know what your doing again.

Whats really upsetting is them knowing exactly how frequently and to what i masturbate. My agents probably begging for retirement. 

So you&#39;re saying I should send them clips of me masturbating on webcam regularly to keep up their spirits?

On a related note<blockquote>
So, do you deliver your own mail or do you have your own mail person? But then who delivers his mail? Is there a never-ending chain of mailmen delivering mail to other mailmen?
How does that work for the FBI?

Loop will close somewhere.

Sadly, most of the monitoring these days has been outsourced to cheaper nations, usually in Asia.
Your one-time personal customer information retrieval agent - who know all the other agents who covered your family, and had better reunions with each other than you did at Xmas - is now just whoever logs on at the Listening Post in Mumbai that day.

They simply run their face recognition software.So make sure you put a little sticker on your front webcam and you should be fine. 

What happens if I haven been putting s sticker on my webcam...

You are gonna die

They&#39;ve been watching you beat your meat.

i ain’t no guy

It’s the NSA and CIA,  not the FBI.

this cries for an AMA request. you may not need to post the request though, <em>they</em> have read it already anyway.

Let me ask him

I&#39;m a bot, <em>bleep</em>, <em>bloop</em>.

Watched me grow

This is where a strong sql expert does the job of 1000 fbi agents

You guys are lucky having the same agent, my MI5 look out will more than likely lose my data by leaving his laptop on a train, bloody tit. How can he lose my save file after so long :/

Stay right where you are.

NSA, not FBI. 
I mean.....carry on.

My FBI agent has seen some shit...

My agent is probably so curious as to what I&#39;m gonna do with my life which sucks because he isn&#39;t gonna be proud
