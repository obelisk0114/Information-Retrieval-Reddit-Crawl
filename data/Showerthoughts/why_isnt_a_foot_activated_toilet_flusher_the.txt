Does anyone else wish they could flush the toilet in public places (or their home) without touching the the flusher with their hand? Motion activated sensors rarely work and lead to the toilets never flushing at all. I can‚Äôt be the only one that has thought of this....


labmix     Sat Feb 3 20:38:11 2018 UTC

It has existed for decades.

I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s uncommon.  Maybe liability from people falling?  Maybe the extra plumbing is too much cost?  I can&#39;t really think of a good reason.  
Also, motion sensors do work, you just have to change the batteries.  


butlerjw     Sat Feb 3 21:11:47 2018 UTC

That picture is exactly what should be stamdard imo! I have never seen one in the wild. 


Versatile337     Sat Feb 3 23:47:54 2018 UTC

They cost the slightest bit more


im_that_guy_402     Sun Feb 4 05:10:41 2018 UTC

they wouldn&#39;t be compliant with ADA laws.  


guitarworms     Sun Feb 4 00:44:48 2018 UTC

Who ever invented motion sensor flush toilets needs to be throat punched, hanged by their toenails in a tree which gets cut down into a bed of roses and the tree falls on top of said person.  


whale-tail     Sun Feb 4 06:42:14 2018 UTC

Or maybe something a little more mild, like burned alive


Zomunieo     Sun Feb 4 07:35:16 2018 UTC

No need for that. They should just have one forcibly installed in every bathroom of their house.


TheHeartlessCookie     Sun Feb 4 08:32:17 2018 UTC

Hey now, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s going a bit <em>too</em> far?


guitarworms     Sun Feb 4 18:34:08 2018 UTC

Clearly Poseidon‚Äôs kiss, is no one with him.


johnroben98     Sat Feb 3 21:08:28 2018 UTC

But they go off as soon as you stand up to wipe... I did find a way around it though. I usually put a piece of TP over the sensor so I can take it off when I actually want to flush.


butlerjw     Sat Feb 3 21:13:55 2018 UTC

Exactly this. It really grinds my gears when I see crappy design/construction like this that was probably over sold to flush universities trying to be ‚Äúeco friendly‚Äù When in reality, the solar paneled sensors result in twice the amount of water wasted bc of multiple flushing and more work for the janitors. Sad!


gerry2stitch     Sun Feb 4 05:52:17 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not to save water. It&#39;s to make one less thing our now possibly poop covered hands have to touch before we have a chance to wash them. 


labmix     Sun Feb 4 09:03:27 2018 UTC

It&#39;s also to keep the restroom from smelling terrible because some animals won&#39;t ever flush.  Urine gets really rancid when it sits.

Nobody accidentally pisses on hand-flushers


PM_me_things_u_like     Sun Feb 4 08:04:42 2018 UTC

I know these toilets probably all look the same but is that toilet somewhere in the western side of San Francisco?


PLAYONYAH     Sat Feb 3 18:31:08 2018 UTC

This is an amazing idea, I am surprised that there is an actually good shower thought 


sparcasm     Sun Feb 4 00:00:05 2018 UTC

It‚Äôs just easier and cheaper and easier to fix when broken, when the lever is closest to the mechanism in the tank that makes it flush. 
Am I taking crazy pills or is this not blatantly obvious?! Wtf?


PLAYONYAH     Sun Feb 4 01:14:18 2018 UTC

It‚Äôs just not commonly known 


neph4     Sat Feb 3 18:37:32 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve always used my feet to flush public toilets. Not hard to raise your leg ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


butlerjw     Sat Feb 3 19:13:25 2018 UTC

That used to work... However, many modern toilets now have buttons....It‚Äôs almost as genius of a design as the circular mouse for the old imac.


UniversDesAmes     Sun Feb 4 04:12:25 2018 UTC

I only started seeing circle buttons when I moved to France. Never seen them in the US.


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 04:51:39 2018 UTC

I see them occasionally here in the northern US.


johnroben98     Sat Feb 3 21:07:25 2018 UTC

Yeah, but then the one guy who can&#39;t raise his legs has to touch what&#39;s been on your shoes with his hand...


SpaceCase206     Sun Feb 4 04:29:15 2018 UTC

Good thing he&#39;s gonna wash his hands before leaving the bathroom


GhoulAndGambler     Sat Feb 3 18:25:25 2018 UTC

That‚Äôs a great idea, actually.


_Calculus_     Sun Feb 4 00:25:32 2018 UTC

It‚Äôs also something that already exists.


sim642     Sat Feb 3 19:02:42 2018 UTC

Simple:<ol><li>It&#39;s cheaper to manufacture a toilet that has the flush button right where the tank is, not somewhere else on the floor.</li><li>People wouldn&#39;t know how to flush it and they just won&#39;t. Not a pleasant sight.</li></ol>


nihsor     Sun Feb 4 04:13:57 2018 UTC

How hard is it to figure out? If it&#39;s being newly introduced put a sign / label above it.


im_that_guy_402     Sun Feb 4 05:15:36 2018 UTC

Toilets that use a flush valve don&#39;t actually have  an integral flush button, instead it is a wholly separate device. Only a slight increase in material to pipe it an additional couple of feet. (I&#39;m a plumber) 


Jimmigill     Sun Feb 4 00:00:52 2018 UTC

All toilets are foot activated of you want it bad enough.


crazy_cat_broad     Sat Feb 3 23:01:10 2018 UTC

Eh you‚Äôre going to wash your hands anyway, I hope...


Dranj     Sat Feb 3 19:30:35 2018 UTC

Can&#39;t speak for all public toilets (many of which switched to some sort of sensor about a decade ago, anyway), but most flushing mechanisms are designed for simplicity.  It&#39;s a straightforward device (pull down on one side of a lever to raise the other, which also unseals the valve) that can be easily inspected for failure, and easily replaced.  You could still keep it fairly simple and update to a foot activated mechanism, but you&#39;d be introducing more parts that could possibly break as well.


hypnos1620     Sat Feb 3 20:49:43 2018 UTC

The problem with anything activated by stepping is that too much force can accidentally/intentionally be used, causing it to break. Imagine what your typical bored teenager would do when left with a stompable switch in the bathroom. School bathrooms would be flooded twice a week.


gmode121     Sun Feb 4 09:48:25 2018 UTC

Been using the same foot activated trash can for years now and that is made of hard plastic. Since it is pretty much tje same idea as a foot activsted toilet seat I think that breaking it with your feet is not going to be near as much of a problem as you think. If the switch is recessed and there is only a bit of room to put your foot in and also to lift above the switch then they would have a much harder time just stomping it to death.  


Muzzy637     Sun Feb 4 00:02:49 2018 UTC

Any toilet can be flushed with your foot if you try hard enough!


Jena_TheFatGirl     Sun Feb 4 04:14:07 2018 UTC

I learned recently that in Japan everyone uses a bit of toilet paper to flush the handle without touching it. I am 35 years old and when I saw that I was like <strong>eyes wide</strong> omg of COURSE! <strong>facepalm</strong> How did the rest of us not put that together, I wonder?


notverytinydancer     Sun Feb 4 08:29:46 2018 UTC

Whilst in Japan for an extended period I saw exactly one person wash their hands after the toilet. I asked a girl and she had never seen it in the ladies. In a place obsessed with arbitrary and defunct rules (like never blowing your nose as this may indicate to another samurai that you are sick and easily defeated, but rather sniffing and snorting all day) there is little to no common sense amongst the natives.


CheekyYoghurts     Sat Feb 3 20:42:14 2018 UTC

In parts of Asia and Arabia they&#39;ve had these for decades.

Showers also need pedal foot controls.


throwawayggl     Sun Feb 4 02:04:09 2018 UTC

I thought about it long time back, and wanted to do a diy thing but too lazy 


BrokenFemurs     Sun Feb 4 02:34:00 2018 UTC

I just flush the toilet handle with my foot


wujtzr     Sun Feb 4 02:59:07 2018 UTC

I remember the elementary school I went to for kindergarten &amp; first grade had the handle to flush near the ground on the wall next to the toilet. They remodeled a couple years later and I&#39;ve never seen it anywhere since. Probably cuz the school was built in the 60s and it was now early 00s


puffinrockrules     Sun Feb 4 04:12:57 2018 UTC

You wash your hands immediately afterwards 


Rabidleopard     Sun Feb 4 05:53:10 2018 UTC

If your flexible enough and have good enough balance all toilets are foot activated. 


alethu88     Sun Feb 4 07:10:41 2018 UTC

I roundhouse that button all day


Lyoko_warrior95     Sun Feb 4 07:16:16 2018 UTC

Well the sensors can always be calibrated and adjusted to a certain sensitivity of when it flushes. At Walmart, there are two bathrooms. (Obviously) there is one in the front that will flush after our walk away a certain distance and it has a delay time. The one in the back, is more sensitive. The second I walk forward a bit, it flushes immediately. They are all different. 


Splice1138     Sun Feb 4 08:16:54 2018 UTC

This comes up often enough that I have to wonder why so many people are so squeamish or germ phobic. Wash your f-ing hands. The door handle is probably dirtier anyway.


smolfloofyredhead     Sun Feb 4 08:58:44 2018 UTC

There&#39;s a little something called washing your hands...

Wang_Dangler     Sun Feb 4 21:10:57 2018 UTC

I remember using these quite a bit as a kid. Here&#39;s the problem: the floor is often slippery in the public bathroom (either from ambient moisture condensation or people pissing on the floor) which makes standing on one foot while applying a lateral force with the other foot a recipe for disaster. Not to mention, the pedal itself is often wet from piss or water and your foot can slip off when pressing it. 
It might, at first, seem more sanitary to use your foot and shoe to flush the toilet, but you&#39;ll quickly change your mind when you end up laying on your back in a puddle of piss - like I did, at least once. I&#39;ve developed a slight phobia of these things.
Using your pinky which you can immediately and easily wash is a small price to pay to keep the rest of your body dry.
