There are actually 6 sizes - peewee, small, medium, large, extra-large, and jumbo. Size is set by weight per dozen. Peewee eggs are under 42gr each while jumbo egss are 70gr or better (each). The size range is set by the Us Dept of Agriculture.

I used to see small and medium in the US.  Have not in a long time.
Where would you get &quot;PeeWee&quot; eggs?  need them for baking purposes.

Very small chickens. Seriously though, no idea. Rarely see anything below large in the markets.

In the UK we have small, medium, large and XL. I&#39;m guessing this is a US thing?

In Canada we have the same. I&#39;ve got a dozen medium eggs in my fridge right now.

They share their sizing range with Chico&#39;s, so that&#39;s all that was left.

There are many sizes of eggs. The ones we see in the store are not the only ones. 
Just like fruits and veggies. The consumers in the store never see the ugly ones.
