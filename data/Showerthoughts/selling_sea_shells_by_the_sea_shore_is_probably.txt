Not just shells, but <em>fossils.</em> She was critical in the development of paleontology as a science.<blockquote>
Throughout the 20th century, beginning with H. A. Forde and his The Heroine of Lyme Regis: The Story of Mary Anning the Celebrated Geologist (1925), a number of writers saw Anning&#39;s life as inspirational. According to P. J. McCartney in Henry de la Beche (1978), she was the basis of Terry Sullivan&#39;s lyrics to the 1908 song [69] which became the popular tongue twister, &quot;She Sells Seashells&quot;:<pre><code>She sells seashells on the seashoreThe shells she sells are seashells, I&#39;m sureSo if she sells seashells on the seashoreThen I&#39;m sure she sells seashore shells.</code></pre>

Have you never been to a souvenir shop in a beach town?  They do quite well selling shells and T-shirt’s and blah blah blah 


BillionTonsHyperbole     Sun Feb 4 18:32:52 2018 UTC

An alternate explanation:
It&#39;s the only way she can survive since she broke her spine in that horrible butter-churning accident. She drags herself across the beach at low tide every dawn, clawing at the wet sand, spitting out mouthfuls of salt water from errant waves, dodging piles of medical waste as best she can, just to get a half-full basket of shells that she sells to passing tourists on the boardwalk beneath which she sleeps.
She secretly hopes that one morning, the swells will roll far out to sea, exposing vast acres of unsearched sand in the golden light of the morning, only to return in a towering tsunami promising the sweet release of death. Tumbling through the rushing torrent, her lungs filling with saltwater and flotsam, seconds away from the comfort of oblivion, her last thought will be about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">him</a>.

Eh, probably no worse than selling corn next to a corn field. Just write &quot;Fresh!&quot; on the sign.


Skystrike7     Sun Feb 4 22:17:57 2018 UTC

Corn fields aren&#39;t public property. You couldn&#39;t go pick the corn legally to circumvent the vendor.


KeepCalmJeepOn     Sun Feb 4 22:42:27 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t know man, Jimmy crack corn and I don&#39;t care.


Wafflotron     Sun Feb 4 18:27:16 2018 UTC

It’s also probably a pretty common repost.

This is from that 70s show, Jackie says it in season 7


sdmitch16     Sun Feb 4 23:13:25 2018 UTC

I read it in a nursery rhyme book before That 70&#39;s show aired. More importantly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anning" rel="nofollow">it&#39;s about a real person</a>


mudahg     Mon Feb 5 01:20:15 2018 UTC

I didn&#39;t mean the nursery rhyme, I meant the comment that it&#39;s a bad place to sell sea shells

I bought a big conch shell from a guy on the beach in Belize. Threw it away a few days later cause it smelled like a dead hooker


ddrrtt     Sun Feb 4 22:37:51 2018 UTC

Hmmm. How do you know what dead hookers smell like?


Nightliker     Sun Feb 4 19:26:56 2018 UTC

unless you have an army of employees scour the beach and coastline and claim the supply line. If there are no shells except yours you’ll do well. 


Akeibo     Sun Feb 4 23:21:41 2018 UTC

Do I smell the beginnings of ‘Standard Seashells’??


mhol7597     Sun Feb 4 20:11:10 2018 UTC

If you are actually going to buy shells it is because you were at the sea shore. People dont buy vials of beach sand off Amazon.


enthion     Sun Feb 4 20:45:30 2018 UTC

But, the word of mouth advertising

Nor would answering the question of how much wood a woodchuck could chuck wood, with “as much as he could.”

Tell it to 8 year old me. I tried to sell nice looking rocks on a rocky beach. My uncle bought them for 30 euros out of pity.

Sally sells seashells by the seashore.
Seashores are self-sustaining in seashells. 
Selling seashells by the seashore is a shitty sales strategy.
