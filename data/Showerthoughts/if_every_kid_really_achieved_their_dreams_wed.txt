HA! Jokes on you when I was a kid I wanted to be, &quot;The guy in a warehouse that walks around on the high up walk way with a clipboard.&quot; Aka a foreman. I wanted to be a foreman.
My brother wanted to drive the tractor.


UniversDesAmes     Sun Feb 4 05:25:08 2018 UTC

I told my parents I wanted to be a piece of dirt on a brick in the driveway

My sister wanted to be a checkout operator. Life goal achieved at 14.

My mom is a glorious idiot and she wanted me to be an astronaut. So she prayed to God asking for me to become a <strong>space cadet</strong>. What‚Äôs worse is I think she got her wish...

Yeah mine ended up with a waste of space cadet too

Did your brother at one time ever also want to <strong>be</strong> the tractor?


Temprament     Sun Feb 4 04:36:01 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t ever remember him saying so (he&#39;s older than me) but I would completely believe at one time he would.

AFineDayForScience     Sun Feb 4 09:24:48 2018 UTC

I got an F on a project in 5th grade where we were supposed to draw what we wanted to be when we grew up because I drew a guy sitting on a couch with the word &quot;retired&quot; written over him. 


chasebrendon     Sun Feb 4 09:29:26 2018 UTC

Lol, I remember being about 8 and the project was to draw your dream house. Most of us drew the most amazing fantasy houses. One kid just drew his own house. He got an A! Life isn‚Äôt just!

Your teacher was just jealous because her salary was shit Early retirement is a good goal to have lolol

There are plenty of kids that became YouTube stars though

Barlakopofai     Sun Feb 4 09:14:59 2018 UTC

Nyeh. I mean at least it&#39;s not twitch. Alot of them have something going for them, charisma, comedy, their voice, some degree of creativity, unlike twitch, where the entire reasoning behind their fame is that they interact with people starved for attention <sup>when they give them money</sup> while doing a live Let&#39;s Play. Even the two times is just that, he&#39;s just a bit more theatrical about it.


SpencerHayes     Sun Feb 4 22:14:38 2018 UTC

You&#39;re watching the wrong streamers


HauschkasFoot     Sun Feb 4 00:39:34 2018 UTC

Who wouldn&#39;t though. Atleast besides the fact that youtube is going downhill, if it wasn&#39;t that would be a dream job. You get to play games/animate/ do beauty stuff/ what you love every day and get payed for it and have lots of people that know you and love you

Your welcome 


CanBurgersSwim     Sun Feb 4 03:17:21 2018 UTC

Ugh, I don&#39;t know how I feel about the YouTube star statement. I myself am an 18-year-old trying to raise a channel since, for various reasons, I can&#39;t get an actual job and have lots of time on my hands as a result; I also have a good personality and sense of humor for YouTube. On the other hand, little Timmy playing COD ain&#39;t gonna make it big any time soon.


GingerGuerrilla     Sun Feb 4 04:32:30 2018 UTC

We‚Äôll be the judge of your personality and sense of humor if you care to provide a link.


CanBurgersSwim     Sun Feb 4 04:38:44 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t have any videos right now aside from an AMV; I&#39;m just starting out. Give me a couple weeks to overclock my computer and then I can record some stuff.


Vaqmed     Sun Feb 4 05:11:00 2018 UTC

wat


CanBurgersSwim     Sun Feb 4 05:19:36 2018 UTC

I&#39;ll give you the short version:
I&#39;m stuck with a dinosaur of a computer and can&#39;t afford a fancy new powerful one at the moment, thus the overclocking. Also, I never said my channel was already successful; I just said I was trying to start it.


Vaqmed     Sun Feb 4 05:23:00 2018 UTC

ye but why weeks to overclock? literally takes 10s with a program if u scared of bios 
edit: also if ur comp is shit overclocking wont rly do much


CanBurgersSwim     Sun Feb 4 05:31:18 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not so much the overclocking itself as it is waiting for Amazon to deliver my laptop cooling pad, and then actually recording once overclocked.


BeenCarl     Sun Feb 4 06:32:07 2018 UTC

Do you know what&#39;s worse than a 50 lb bag of rotting, crusty, herpes filled dicks? Excuses and boy you got a lot of them.


xmu806     Sun Feb 4 07:19:12 2018 UTC

Yeah no kidding. Lol. He could have just said that he isn&#39;t ready to launch his channel yet.


Egonga     Sun Feb 4 12:35:27 2018 UTC

Could you not record some games which require a less powerful PC?

Train Conductor. It&#39;s fancy like that

Fun fact. Conductors are usually engineers in training. You start as a conductor, and handle all the bitch work for the engineer.

My best friend has wanted to be a paleontologist since he was...5? He&#39;s still working on the degree, but he&#39;s making it happen!


Free_Electrocution     Sun Feb 4 07:08:33 2018 UTC

When I was around 8 years old, I remember being disappointed in a cousin who had wanted to be a paleontologist when he was a kid, but changed his mind later. And now I&#39;ve done the same thing (although I&#39;d still love to go dig up some dino bones or artifacts if I found a chance).


Timbershoe     Sun Feb 4 09:22:55 2018 UTC

Off you go then, you can join digs around the world:

If you prefer archeology, you can take a month in Europe and volunteer at digs back to Neolithic times or any time period that interests you onwards:

Free_Electrocution     Sun Feb 4 09:38:53 2018 UTC

Wow, thanks! I&#39;ll keep that in mind for when I have money/transportation/free time (summers are for jobs/internships currently). The closest I&#39;ve been so far is looking for fossilized shark teeth at a beach, this looks way cooler.

Hail_Odins_Beard     Sun Feb 4 18:30:17 2018 UTC

Ha, I remember wanted to be an archeologist, but being told it usually costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep digs going, and that it&#39;s like, atleast 6 years of university and a PHD
I&#39;m in Culinary school ATM...

Hope you don&#39;t plan on saving money by going to Johnson &amp; Wales or CIA.


Christiannemarie     Sun Feb 4 20:13:42 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a Paleontologist since I saw Jurassic Park when I was 3. Now here I am, a year away from earning my B.S. for Geology/Paleontology and applying to grad schools.
It&#39;s hard to follow your dreams because you&#39;re constantly told by adults growing up that you&#39;ll never be able to accomplish this dreams. I think a big part of me getting my degrees is to just prove those people wrong.


attilayavuzer     Sun Feb 4 00:30:30 2018 UTC

If most people followed their dreams, the world&#39;s infrastructure would probably collapse. 


RikerT_USS_Lolipop     Sun Feb 4 20:05:37 2018 UTC

There are actually a lot of little boys that want to be construction workers, truck drivers, engineers and scientists. There are also a lot of little girls that want to be stay at home moms.
There would be way <em>way</em> too many sports stars, but zero marketing managers or deceptive UI developers and that would be pretty sweet.


BizzyM     Sun Feb 4 22:34:10 2018 UTC

terryleopard     Sun Feb 4 03:06:04 2018 UTC

Yeah I wanted to be a vet until I realised there was a lot of animal euthanasia involved.

But Euthanasia treatments are easy.  


Aurora_Fatalis     Sun Feb 4 11:50:49 2018 UTC

It&#39;s the Euthanamerica treatments that costs you the ability to sleep at night.

Pstuc002     Sun Feb 4 20:07:19 2018 UTC

I think I wouldn&#39;t mind being a plumber because as a kid I was fascinated by how sinks and toilets work. I&#39;m currently studying physics instead.


C4rpals     Sun Feb 4 12:35:06 2018 UTC

Don&#39;t think so. For every job that no one wants to take there are people who take every job because no one else does it.

Who&#39;s dream is it to take &quot;every job because no one else does it&quot;?

DarkSoulsExplorer     Sun Feb 4 06:07:19 2018 UTC

Some would end up as  firefighters in KCK.  They‚Äôd get paid for doing nothing.  Then when called out, they‚Äôd act like giant douche babies and harass those who called them out.  
I guess this isn‚Äôt really the proper sub for that comment.


earl_of_lemonparty     Sun Feb 4 09:57:10 2018 UTC

Ha! I&#39;m a mines rescue firefighter and we clash all the time with town firefighters. They don&#39;t like it when our equipment is more specialised and we&#39;re better trained for certain scenarios than they are. Your comment resonates :P

BossAVery     Sun Feb 4 04:06:19 2018 UTC

I&#39;d be a teenage mutant ninja turtle cop. 


mommmabear2     Sun Feb 4 04:37:39 2018 UTC

Don‚Äôt forget trash truck drivers!! We‚Äôd have lots of those too


patrickverbatum     Sun Feb 4 07:39:49 2018 UTC

Mine wants to be a Lego Master Builder.


pmathscos     Sun Feb 4 07:57:21 2018 UTC

As a really young kid, I wanted to be an illustrator. I remember asking my mother who drew the pictures in books and she told me it was an illustrator. So, that lasted a few years.
Then, I wanted to be a chemist all the way up until high school! Then, during my high school chemistry class, I discovered that I hated chemistry, and decided to become a lawyer.
Now, I&#39;m in uni studying to be a mathematician. Funny how things worked out. I wouldn&#39;t ask for a different career path.


Tinydancingbitch     Sun Feb 4 08:21:00 2018 UTC

Don‚Äôt forget the veterinarians and marine biologists 


Paroxysmalism     Sun Feb 4 08:30:52 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a scientist and I am a<sup>n</sup> <sup>applied</sup> scientist.


Fedorito_     Sun Feb 4 09:54:00 2018 UTC

I still want to be an astronaut


MlSANTHROPlSSED     Sun Feb 4 09:58:01 2018 UTC

And Emma Watson would be absolutely run through by now


sun-ray     Sun Feb 4 10:50:37 2018 UTC

I wanted to be James Bond, the Sean Connery original lookalike :)


Android_Obesity     Sun Feb 4 11:23:45 2018 UTC

I think enough of us wanted to be ninja space wizards that, had we all gotten our dreams, they might have been needed to clean up the carnage.


AugeanSpringCleaning     Sun Feb 4 12:04:23 2018 UTC

I&#39;d have been a railroad engineer, which, as it turns out, is a job that is integral to many parts of our infrastructure/economy/etc. So... Fuck you selfish assholes.


simsamsom     Sun Feb 4 13:26:55 2018 UTC

And veterinarians...gave that one up when I realized part of the job is putting animals down :(


hilarymeggin     Sun Feb 4 18:10:57 2018 UTC

You and me both. My aunt is an equine vet and I used to go in rounds with her, and thought I wanted to be a vet too. Then one day she had me do a bunch of photocopying for her, and I got to look at glossy pictures of diseased horse hooves and infected eyes and sores... no thank you. I became a dog trainer instead so I get to work with healthy animals!


Johncamp28     Sun Feb 4 13:44:14 2018 UTC

Not true my brother in law wanted to be a garbage man. Never quite achieved that he became a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù...so much for follow your dreams 


Mario6345     Sun Feb 4 13:48:48 2018 UTC

Well I wanted to be a superhero. Unrealistic sure, but I&#39;m the one with superpowers now, not you. Your argument is invalid


aradraugfea     Sun Feb 4 14:00:55 2018 UTC

And Power Rangers.


norskaa     Sun Feb 4 15:25:10 2018 UTC

My dream was to be a pyromaniac so that‚Äôs perfect 


Cuspy_Rucus     Sun Feb 4 16:31:44 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a scientist and now i&#39;m studying pharmacology to try to put that into action! :-)


Tired_Thumb     Sun Feb 4 16:37:01 2018 UTC

Wanted to be a firefighter, am a firefighter. 


LanceFree     Sun Feb 4 17:48:21 2018 UTC

And probably some good teachers, ass-kissers, but really smart. 


Fantastic4unko     Sun Feb 4 17:55:47 2018 UTC

And a fuck load of Jedi.


LunaLuminosity     Sun Feb 4 19:23:29 2018 UTC

I kind of aced that one, having always wanted to be a physicist.
But proving that the grass is always greener, I have to admit that I&#39;m every bit as disappointed as my six year old self would be that theoretical particle physics gives me very little excuse to walk around in a swoopy labcoat all day every day.


W_I_Water     Sun Feb 4 00:37:00 2018 UTC

Can you really have a surplus of fire fighters and astronauts though?


CanBurgersSwim     Sun Feb 4 03:14:19 2018 UTC

That is kind of a good point. It&#39;s good to have extra firefighters around in case of emergency, and it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no room up there for more astronauts.


ZLewisz     Sun Feb 4 09:52:09 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not that there&#39;s not enough space, but the house only has enough room for 6 people, and it&#39;s the most expensive thing humans have ever built.  


PyroDesu     Sun Feb 4 11:12:20 2018 UTC

I mean, that&#39;s because we had some really fucking stupid priorities.
Even if we ignore everything before the Space Shuttle, those external tanks that were bigger than the goddamn orbiter (46.9 meters long, 8.4 meters across) would have made for one hell of a wet workshop-based station. Hell, the Shuttles actually had to perform a specific OMS burn to ditch the tanks (plus a ton of hydrogen and four tons of oxygen). So why ditch them? (Hint: the answer is <em>most probably</em> politics.)


quarterlifecrisis_01     Sun Feb 4 03:57:07 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a mermaid. 


GingerGuerrilla     Sun Feb 4 04:41:06 2018 UTC

<a href="https://weekiwachee.com/mermaids/">You still could!</a>


Cho42     Sun Feb 4 02:48:46 2018 UTC

I wanted to be Evel Knievel.


raindropdroptopz     Sun Feb 4 03:04:35 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a gas station attendant


ladymiku     Sun Feb 4 19:59:42 2018 UTC

&quot;hello biuty, send bobs&quot; ;-)


dymphymetz     Sun Feb 4 06:07:07 2018 UTC

i wanted to be a fairy princess....


FleshRobot0     Sun Feb 4 06:11:39 2018 UTC

I think it&#39;s for the best I didn&#39;t achieve my childhood dream. I wanted to start a world-wide war that killed everyone


Kafka_Valokas     Sun Feb 4 13:54:50 2018 UTC

Is it possible that you were a bit of an edgelord?


FleshRobot0     Sun Feb 4 15:32:34 2018 UTC

Absolutely. The fucking edgiest. I really did want the war, but I think I just wanted it so I could say that and get reactions


Kafka_Valokas     Sun Feb 4 17:17:43 2018 UTC

I kind of get the appeal of it. We had a guy in elementary school who was exactly like that. Ironically, it is pretty much me who is the edgelord now - or at least what would be considered one.


TheWeeGinger     Sun Feb 4 06:16:52 2018 UTC

And marine biologists...


magnoliasmanor     Sun Feb 4 06:19:23 2018 UTC

It&#39;d take <em>forever</em> to get my damn taco at taco bell


nub_ayun     Sun Feb 4 07:39:48 2018 UTC

I wanted to be the first person to make a hybrid of a plant and an animal. Yeah...


JxGx928     Sun Feb 4 08:18:31 2018 UTC

When I was a kid I wanted to be a baseball (not baseball player, but an actual baseball...don‚Äôt ask.)  I am now a fire fighter, medical first responder, and deputy sheriff. 


Schinderella     Sun Feb 4 08:28:21 2018 UTC

I think we would have way too many paleontologists too. Dinosaurs were my life when I was a wee lad.


LinShuLe     Sun Feb 4 08:57:34 2018 UTC

I think you are getting mixedup between archeologists and paleontologists


Schinderella     Sun Feb 4 08:58:28 2018 UTC

True my bad correcting it


pseudo__gamer     Sun Feb 4 08:31:50 2018 UTC

I&#39;d be a glassblower by now


chickenners     Sun Feb 4 08:32:18 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a nurse, so I became one. Living the dream...


JIMBLYB     Sun Feb 4 08:50:01 2018 UTC

What about power rangers? 


Motleystew17     Sun Feb 4 09:07:56 2018 UTC

My brother wanted to be an elephant scrubber. So we would have at least one of those.


SubtleMockery     Sun Feb 4 09:22:58 2018 UTC

And one incredibly good Spider-Man.


SavagePanda332211     Sun Feb 4 09:43:21 2018 UTC

We had a presentation in kindergarten where every kid either said firefighters or policeman... except for the one kid who told a crowd of parents he wanted to be a thief. 


CaseAub12     Sun Feb 4 09:47:12 2018 UTC

Man i didn‚Äôt have a plan when I was in 2nd grade and it literally is a metaphor for the last few years. 
Got a degreeEntered by fieldGot hammered like a fucking nail Left my fieldGot an industry job not using my degreePays great People are wonderful Couldn‚Äôt be happier. 
TLDR fuck college learn a trade. 
Edit: Auto correct fail. 


ladymiku     Sun Feb 4 20:01:37 2018 UTC

I want to be an Avon lady! Or at least a makeup artist. Do scholarships even work for trade schools? ü§î


CaseAub12     Sun Feb 4 20:25:22 2018 UTC

Depends. If you get grants in high school they have a lot of stipulations. But always apply for grants because you could always use an $500 


PetefromAccounting     Sun Feb 4 09:52:23 2018 UTC

Yeah I wanted to be a bus driver. 


McCommie     Sun Feb 4 09:57:20 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a garbage man, simply because they got to ride on the back of the trucks. 


bonesnaps     Sun Feb 4 10:04:03 2018 UTC

And not a rocket would catch fire on planet earth.. for very long.


holdonwhileipoop     Sun Feb 4 10:06:55 2018 UTC

You forgot the ballerinas.  Shitloads of ballerinas.


XOIIO     Sun Feb 4 10:07:57 2018 UTC

You can never have enough astronauts, the more you have the more highly risky manned missions to other planets you can attempt.


phunnypunny     Sun Feb 4 10:13:19 2018 UTC

Consequently we would no longer have a shortage of men
Nor engineers and physicists and movers and construction workers due to overflow sideways


silverkingx2     Sun Feb 4 10:13:53 2018 UTC

Delending on the age, id be an archeologist, engineer, then super villain.


garryx26     Sun Feb 4 10:17:51 2018 UTC

And pilots , don&#39;t forget pilots


RohdKill_PA     Sun Feb 4 10:30:26 2018 UTC

And garbage men!


bbcfoursubtitles     Sun Feb 4 10:30:48 2018 UTC

Would we though? When was the last time you heard a kid saying they want to be an astronaut or a firefighter? Mostly I hear kids saying they want to be youtubers


PrasunJW     Sun Feb 4 10:59:07 2018 UTC

I wanted to be Cop, then a scientist, then a writer, then a youtuber, then a singer, then a pianist, then a  Stalin, then a Musk..(I skipped lot of tv show mains like Ben 10,Kakashi Hatake, Light Yagamj, etc) 


losing_mike     Sun Feb 4 11:00:30 2018 UTC

Meaning that firefighters and astronauts would become a low paid job that no one would want to do and around around around it goes! 


lostFox9     Sun Feb 4 11:00:59 2018 UTC

I thought most kids wanted to be football and basketball players


GocoZwei     Sun Feb 4 11:07:44 2018 UTC

I wanted to have a chance.


mayor123asdf     Sun Feb 4 11:10:18 2018 UTC

Well, I&#39;d be a ninja right now.


dear_twitter     Sun Feb 4 11:42:24 2018 UTC

Not more than engineers though.


eddie_larose     Sun Feb 4 11:58:46 2018 UTC

And cowboys smh


Connor1736     Sun Feb 4 12:03:13 2018 UTC

And garbage collectors.


Erogamer214     Sun Feb 4 12:03:47 2018 UTC

This would be a good writing prompt. Just imagine a society where every single person is able to achieve the job of their dreams, how would it function?


rjtiger126     Sun Feb 4 12:04:44 2018 UTC

If I never knew what I wanted to be, does that mean I would be stuck in limbo?


pyoochoon     Sun Feb 4 12:06:17 2018 UTC

Kids these days want to become Logan Paul


Vindace     Sun Feb 4 12:09:34 2018 UTC

When I was little, I wanted (still do actually, just never followed it) to be an orchestra conductor. Unfortunately, there are lots of cool career paths I wish I&#39;d followed, and now at 21 I feel like I&#39;m starting too late to change what I&#39;m doing, but I almost still haven&#39;t picked anything yet.


Puck-Ey     Sun Feb 4 13:15:26 2018 UTC

I‚Äôve just seen this! At 31 I retrained to do the job of my dreams - theatre tech. Made enough money to pay off my debts and realised it wasn‚Äôt for me. At 36 I‚Äôm retraining as a school teacher - it really IS for me.
My friend who builds bridges retrained at 28.
My friend who runs his own IT company was a doctor‚Äôs receptionist until he was 30.


bluepandaice     Sun Feb 4 12:12:10 2018 UTC

i wanted to be a carpenter like my dad


UniqueUsername11780     Sun Feb 4 12:14:02 2018 UTC

Well, I don&#39;t know about firefighters and astronauts.   I really wanted to drive a garbage truck.  Sadly, I did not achieve my dream.  


KenwayOTT     Sun Feb 4 12:24:33 2018 UTC

Always room for more firefighters


americandisco     Sun Feb 4 12:39:51 2018 UTC

And the problem iiiis?


Deeyennay     Sun Feb 4 12:46:51 2018 UTC

I wanted to work at the cash register at a local supermarket, because I thought they could keep all the money. That‚Äôs when I first learned the term ‚Äúboss‚Äù.


BooksNapsSnacks     Sun Feb 4 12:59:57 2018 UTC

5 yr old me wanted to be a live theater actress. Adult me is so glad not to do that for a job.


KrishaCZ     Sun Feb 4 13:14:25 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a pilot, paleontologist and lego designer. I still want to be a lego designer.


Kafka_Valokas     Sun Feb 4 13:41:43 2018 UTC

I always wanted to be a construction worker as a kid... yeah.


GarimaASociopath     Sun Feb 4 14:04:31 2018 UTC

Well... not a fire fighter....But I agree with that Astronaut one!!


rdub916     Sun Feb 4 14:31:34 2018 UTC

What about all the ninjas!?


miojo47     Sun Feb 4 15:11:32 2018 UTC

I didn&#39;t know what i wanted to be then and i still don&#39;t know now lmao 
I guess you could say I&#39;ve been consistently confused.


somethingitalic     Sun Feb 4 15:17:15 2018 UTC

Since I was young, I&#39;ve been saying all I wanted to be is happy.


PM_ME_NAKED_CAMERAS     Sun Feb 4 16:03:14 2018 UTC

You say that like it&#39;s a bad thing. 


CrapBag94     Sun Feb 4 16:10:34 2018 UTC

Alright, Nick Swardson


spacegreaser     Sun Feb 4 16:18:32 2018 UTC

There is infact a huge surplus of firefighters at least where I live (aspiring firefighter/paramedic here)


DeathOfALego     Sun Feb 4 16:46:25 2018 UTC

I‚Äôd be perfectly fine with that. 


bobbyjs1984     Sun Feb 4 17:07:39 2018 UTC

Not really, all kids want to be now is reality TV stars or YouTubers. Sad future ahead


hoodsaiyan     Sun Feb 4 17:11:29 2018 UTC

There wouldn&#39;t be a spacecraft fire for years.


blackcatt42     Sun Feb 4 17:24:29 2018 UTC

My aspiration was to become ‚Äúa teenager‚Äù so I accomplished what I wanted and all I had to do was believe in myself ! 


vadermustdie     Sun Feb 4 18:07:17 2018 UTC

When I was 10, my mom asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her I wanted to be a mail room clerk because it seemed like an easy job. 
A part of her died that day.


hilarymeggin     Sun Feb 4 18:07:26 2018 UTC

Not to mention ballerinas!


skubaloob     Sun Feb 4 18:30:55 2018 UTC

I imagine we‚Äôd need more firefighters in a world where a child like me eventually ended up with a rocket ship. I bet it just about balances.


firefightin     Sun Feb 4 18:55:17 2018 UTC

If I achieved my dreams, my username would be &quot;doctor&quot;... :(


heyheyhayhay     Sun Feb 4 19:13:14 2018 UTC

Schools attempt to teach everybody white collar skills. It&#39;s like there is some fantasy that if educational practices were up to par and kids motivated enough, we could have a whole planet of middle managers or better. It&#39;s moments like these where I suspect that public education mainly exists to provide an efficient aptitude/talent selection system to the governments and corporations. Anyway, I&#39;ll just leave this here while I put away my shiny hat and go about my business.


princeofchaos11     Sun Feb 4 19:14:56 2018 UTC

And football-playing kings in space. 


ladymiku     Sun Feb 4 20:05:53 2018 UTC

football-playing space ninja kings who fight zombie Nazis!


fuzzyoctopus97     Sun Feb 4 19:30:06 2018 UTC

Is that really a bad thing though?


Bajgboing     Sun Feb 4 19:45:28 2018 UTC

And there would be about 1,500 professional sports franchises in the US 


charlieburgers1     Sun Feb 4 19:46:59 2018 UTC

And i&#39;d finally become a secret agent. 


snazeco     Sun Feb 4 20:03:52 2018 UTC

UsernameNumberZero     Sun Feb 4 20:10:26 2018 UTC

Don‚Äôt forget the pirates and cowboys. 


Legin_666     Sun Feb 4 06:04:58 2018 UTC

I wanted to be a scientist, now Im a mechanical engineer. Pretty close


Bertha_QuetzalRider     Sun Feb 4 21:07:12 2018 UTC

The overwhelming majority of people will only ever achieve mediocrity in life. Nothing wrong with that, either. Look at how many industries rely on the mediocre as a backbone. It really does take all kinds.


MyTrueIdiotSelf990     Sun Feb 4 21:57:44 2018 UTC

Humanity <em>wishes</em> it had a surplus of astronauts.


theMaineCoon14     Sun Feb 4 22:19:54 2018 UTC

I wanted to own a kennel 


golgol12     Sun Feb 4 22:53:15 2018 UTC

Make video games.   
Made it.  


Slyfox3157     Sun Feb 4 23:23:52 2018 UTC

I was going to be a veterinarian, but adult me <em>can&#39;t stand</em> animals. Life would have been a bitch! 


Akitiki     Sun Feb 4 23:39:16 2018 UTC

A veterinarian, then turned paleontologist, specifically the one digging fossils, or putting them together for display. 
Now I make stuffed animals. 


Skinnybear310     Sun Feb 4 11:33:36 2018 UTC

&quot;Why are there 16 presidents dad&quot;?&quot;Because in America you can be what you want if you beg hard enough, that why I&#39;m an astronaut&quot;.


ladymiku     Sun Feb 4 20:07:15 2018 UTC

&quot;Any damn fool can be a president, so why do I have to go to college???&quot;


arjunmohan     Sun Feb 4 09:58:55 2018 UTC

No we wouldn&#39;t have a surplus, we just employ a small number because we have a surplus of people trying to be cunts
/S


WickedTriggered     Sun Feb 4 00:43:44 2018 UTC

Not me.  I‚Äôd be a doctor/fighter pilot/race car driver/pussy slayer.  
1 out of 4 ain‚Äôt bad. 


adrunkangel     Sun Feb 4 00:58:51 2018 UTC
