HA! Jokes on you when I was a kid I wanted to be, &quot;The guy in a warehouse that walks around on the high up walk way with a clipboard.&quot; Aka a foreman. I wanted to be a foreman.
My brother wanted to drive the tractor.

Well, has he?

Oh ya. We have both sang, &quot;She thinks my tractors sexy!&quot; many times while driving a tractor. (Parents own a tractor now)

Workin all day in the hot summer sun...

I told my parents I wanted to be a piece of dirt on a brick in the driveway

Don‚Äôt let your dreams be dreams

I‚Äôve always said ‚ÄúThat UniversDesAmes guy is a real piece of dirt.‚Äù

My sister wanted to be a checkout operator. Life goal achieved at 14.

It‚Äôs all downhill from there if you make your life goal at 14 

My mom is a glorious idiot and she wanted me to be an astronaut. So she prayed to God asking for me to become a <strong>space cadet</strong>. What‚Äôs worse is I think she got her wish...

Yeah mine ended up with a waste of space cadet too

Lots of drugs?

Did your brother at one time ever also want to <strong>be</strong> the tractor?

I don&#39;t ever remember him saying so (he&#39;s older than me) but I would completely believe at one time he would.

I wanted to be a pawn shop  for as long as I can remember 

I wanted to be a pile driver operator.

I drove a combine I was good at it. I drove a tractor I sucked at it. Guess which one was more fun.

That‚Äôs okay. I wanted to deliver pizzas. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
To be fair, my kid logic was that I wanted to be the guy who brought happiness to people.

For the longest time I wanted to be a professional tapdancer/whistler. I&#39;ve failed childhood me.

I remember telling my dad I wanted to be a miner. 
I didn&#39;t even play Minecraft. 

I wanted to be foreskin, but that idea was thrown out decades ago..

I wanted to be a rock star. Fortunately for you all, didn‚Äôt happen.

I got an F on a project in 5th grade where we were supposed to draw what we wanted to be when we grew up because I drew a guy sitting on a couch with the word &quot;retired&quot; written over him. 

Lol, I remember being about 8 and the project was to draw your dream house. Most of us drew the most amazing fantasy houses. One kid just drew his own house. He got an A! Life isn‚Äôt just!

Theses days you‚Äôd have a lot more WWE stars, you tube stars and sports stars.

There are plenty of kids that became YouTube stars though

Some would argue that it was too many...

<a href="/r/Elsagate" rel="nofollow">r/Elsagate</a>

Nyeh. I mean at least it&#39;s not twitch. Alot of them have something going for them, charisma, comedy, their voice, some degree of creativity, unlike twitch, where the entire reasoning behind their fame is that they interact with people starved for attention <sup>when they give them money</sup> while doing a live Let&#39;s Play. Even the two times is just that, he&#39;s just a bit more theatrical about it.

If I asked a little kid what he wanted to be when he grew up and he said ‚Äúa YouTube star,‚Äù I‚Äôd slap him.

Man Assaults Aspiring Youth!!!
<em>1.5 million views</em>
<em>Thumbnail inexplicably tits.</em>

the camera sees all

Well you&#39;re kinda rude

Who wouldn&#39;t though. Atleast besides the fact that youtube is going downhill, if it wasn&#39;t that would be a dream job. You get to play games/animate/ do beauty stuff/ what you love every day and get payed for it and have lots of people that know you and love you

If I had a kid who said a YouTube star, I think I would disown them. 

Ugh, I don&#39;t know how I feel about the YouTube star statement. I myself am an 18-year-old trying to raise a channel since, for various reasons, I can&#39;t get an actual job and have lots of time on my hands as a result; I also have a good personality and sense of humor for YouTube. On the other hand, little Timmy playing COD ain&#39;t gonna make it big any time soon.

We‚Äôll be the judge of your personality and sense of humor if you care to provide a link.

I don&#39;t have any videos right now aside from an AMV; I&#39;m just starting out. Give me a couple weeks to overclock my computer and then I can record some stuff.

wat

I&#39;ll give you the short version:
I&#39;m stuck with a dinosaur of a computer and can&#39;t afford a fancy new powerful one at the moment, thus the overclocking. Also, I never said my channel was already successful; I just said I was trying to start it.

ye but why weeks to overclock? literally takes 10s with a program if u scared of bios 
edit: also if ur comp is shit overclocking wont rly do much

It&#39;s not so much the overclocking itself as it is waiting for Amazon to deliver my laptop cooling pad, and then actually recording once overclocked.

Do you know what&#39;s worse than a 50 lb bag of rotting, crusty, herpes filled dicks? Excuses and boy you got a lot of them.

Yeah no kidding. Lol. He could have just said that he isn&#39;t ready to launch his channel yet.

Could you not record some games which require a less powerful PC?

About the only thing this dinosaur can handle is Solitaire.

I wanted to be a train driver...

Train Conductor. It&#39;s fancy like that

I wanted to not be a failure...

We can always be the best failure possible.

You aren‚Äôt a failure.  Keep on keeping on. 

Me too... I failed

Says who? You made me smile so I&#39;d give you at least a B.

Lucky fucker

You&#39;re not a failure bro. Be proud of who you are, and enjoy all you can every day! 

So... Did you achieve your dream?

Nope

So you&#39;re not a failure then?

Listen, mate. This is the human life:
[birth................................death]
As you can see, there is a lot of empty space between birth and death. Since most people can&#39;t bear that much empty space, they fill it with bullshit.
[birth..........Bullshit...........death]
Objectively, Bullshit is the only thing you can fill this empty space with since every attempt of creating something meaningful is doomed to fail in the long term. Thus, it does not matter with which Bullshit specifically you fill your life. Truth is, you can&#39;t fail at life, neither can you succeed. But while you are here, you might as well do whatever you want. I Hope I could help.

... I wanted to be a unicorn

You can be a Unicorn.

Step 1: Buy a corn cob
Step 2: Stab it into your eye socket
Step 3: Remove the cob; un-eyecorn.

Step 1: remove genitals
Step 2: get giant trumpet costume
Step 3: be a eunuch-horn

Step 1: Get hired by university as a community manager
Step 2: Invite select nu metal bands to an on-campus concert on the provision that you can play with them on stage
Step 3: Be a uni-Ko–Øn

...and paleontologist.

My best friend has wanted to be a paleontologist since he was...5? He&#39;s still working on the degree, but he&#39;s making it happen!

When I was around 8 years old, I remember being disappointed in a cousin who had wanted to be a paleontologist when he was a kid, but changed his mind later. And now I&#39;ve done the same thing (although I&#39;d still love to go dig up some dino bones or artifacts if I found a chance).

Off you go then, you can join digs around the world:
<a href="https://observationdeck.kinja.com/want-to-join-a-dinosaur-dig-this-summer-you-can-1584367030">https://observationdeck.kinja.com/want-to-join-a-dinosaur-dig-this-summer-you-can-1584367030</a>
If you prefer archeology, you can take a month in Europe and volunteer at digs back to Neolithic times or any time period that interests you onwards:
<a href="https://digventures.com/">https://digventures.com/</a>

Wow, thanks! I&#39;ll keep that in mind for when I have money/transportation/free time (summers are for jobs/internships currently). The closest I&#39;ve been so far is looking for fossilized shark teeth at a beach, this looks way cooler.

Did you deeply connect with Ross on Friends?

And veterinarians.

Vegetarians?

We&#39;d have too many Luigi boards.

If most people followed their dreams, the world&#39;s infrastructure would probably collapse. 

What about the people who change their dreams
I wanted to be a doc when I was a kid but then I discovered that people die despite medical efforts and I&#39;ll have to disect people in Uni. NOPE FUCK NOPE

Yeah I wanted to be a vet until I realised there was a lot of animal euthanasia involved. 

But Euthanasia treatments are easy.  

It&#39;s the Euthanamerica treatments that costs you the ability to sleep at night.

Our streets would be covered in trash and our pipes would be clogged.

Teenagers do dream of becoming plumbers though, like, the only exposure they get to plumbers is seeing them getting calls from a desperate young woman who needs her &quot;pipes fixed&quot;

My thougts exactly

Don&#39;t think so. For every job that no one wants to take there are people who take every job because no one else does it.

Don&#39;t forget the ballerinas!

I&#39;d be a professional procrastinator. 

I‚Äôm going to be one Real Soon Now

Nowadays we would have a mass of pro gamers...

A lot have where I live, when one fire fighter job comes up 800+ people apply for that one job.

I&#39;m a garbage man!!!

I know you are but what am i

A garbage man

I wanted to be a bus driver...

Did you follow your dream?

I&#39;m an actor now so...I still have the chance

<em>Speed 3</em> could still happen!

That sounds backwards

Is there a Marine Biologist in the house?

My wife...and I‚Äôm a firefighter. Right now I feel like we did life right! 

Can you really have a surplus of fire fighters and astronauts though?

That is kind of a good point. It&#39;s good to have extra firefighters around in case of emergency, and it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no room up there for more astronauts.

It&#39;s not that there&#39;s not enough space, but the house only has enough room for 6 people, and it&#39;s the most expensive thing humans have ever built.  

I mean, that&#39;s because we had some really fucking stupid priorities.
Even if we ignore everything before the Space Shuttle, those external tanks that were bigger than the goddamn orbiter (46.9 meters long, 8.4 meters across) would have made for one hell of a wet workshop-based station. Hell, the Shuttles actually had to perform a specific OMS burn to ditch the tanks (plus a ton of hydrogen and four tons of oxygen). So why ditch them? (Hint: the answer is <em>most probably</em> politics.)

We would have a lot of photographers, and no one to throw away all the crappy pictures.

We have that now

I wanted to be a circus horse rider. Or a mobster&#39;s wife. 

And artists.

Some would end up as  firefighters in KCK.  They‚Äôd get paid for doing nothing.  Then when called out, they‚Äôd act like giant douche babies and harass those who called them out.  
I guess this isn‚Äôt really the proper sub for that comment.

Ha! I&#39;m a mines rescue firefighter and we clash all the time with town firefighters. They don&#39;t like it when our equipment is more specialised and we&#39;re better trained for certain scenarios than they are. Your comment resonates :P

Really? Nobody wanted to be a pirate?

And a crazy amount of pirates

My son wants to be a goat when he grows up :/

Start calling him Billy!

&quot;Billy, honey, stop that. You know we don&#39;t eat the recycling.&quot; 

When I was a child I wanted to live in a birdhouse.
When I asked a colleague at a few years ago. She said when she was a kid she wanted to grow up and be a dog. 
Neither of these things happened. 

I wanted to be a firefighter and I am, I just volunteer. We&#39;re always looking for members, it&#39;d be nice to have a surplus.

I wanted to be in the WNBA as a kid &amp; I remember my elementary art teacher telling me I needed to think of a new career.

I&#39;d be a teenage mutant ninja turtle cop. 

Don‚Äôt forget trash truck drivers!! We‚Äôd have lots of those too

If I had achieved my childhood dreams, I would have been murdered by skeletons before my ninth birthday.

I wanted to be a scientist and I am a<sup>n</sup> <sup>applied</sup> scientist.

And Fighter Jet Pilots.

I wanted to be James Bond, the Sean Connery original lookalike :)

I think enough of us wanted to be ninja space wizards that, had we all gotten our dreams, they might have been needed to clean up the carnage.

I&#39;d have been a railroad engineer, which, as it turns out, is a job that is integral to many parts of our infrastructure/economy/etc. So... Fuck you selfish assholes.

I wanted to be a mermaid. 

<a href="https://weekiwachee.com/mermaids/" rel="nofollow">You still could!</a>

I wanted to be Evel Knievel.

I wanted to be a gas station attendant

i wanted to be a fairy princess....

I think it&#39;s for the best I didn&#39;t achieve my childhood dream. I wanted to start a world-wide war that killed everyone

Is it possible that you were a bit of an edgelord?

And marine biologists...

It&#39;d take <em>forever</em> to get my damn taco at taco bell

I wanted to be a jeep

I wanted to be a velociraptor

I wanted to be the first person to make a hybrid of a plant and an animal. Yeah...

Mine wants to be a Lego Master Builder.

As a really young kid, I wanted to be an illustrator. I remember asking my mother who drew the pictures in books and she told me it was an illustrator. So, that lasted a few years.
Then, I wanted to be a chemist all the way up until high school! Then, during my high school chemistry class, I discovered that I hated chemistry, and decided to become a lawyer.
Now, I&#39;m in uni studying to be a mathematician. Funny how things worked out. I wouldn&#39;t ask for a different career path.

Fortnite would be streaming non-stop 

When I was a kid I wanted to be a baseball (not baseball player, but an actual baseball...don‚Äôt ask.)  I am now a fire fighter, medical first responder, and deputy sheriff. 

Don‚Äôt forget the veterinarians and marine biologists 

I think we would have way too many paleontologists too. Dinosaurs were my life when I was a wee lad.

I think you are getting mixedup between archeologists and paleontologists

True my bad correcting it

I&#39;d be a glassblower by now

I wanted to be a nurse, so I became one. Living the dream...

What about power rangers? 

My brother wanted to be an elephant scrubber. So we would have at least one of those.

And dinosaurs wouldn&#39;t be extinct. 

And one incredibly good Spider-Man.

We had a presentation in kindergarten where every kid either said firefighters or policeman... except for the one kid who told a crowd of parents he wanted to be a thief. 

Man i didn‚Äôt have a plan when I was in 2nd grade and it literally is a metaphor for the last few years. 
Got a degreeEntered by fieldGot hammered like a fucking nail Left my fieldGot an industry job not using my degreePays great People are wonderful Couldn‚Äôt be happier. 
TLDR fuck college learn a trade. 
Edit: Auto correct fail. 

Yeah I wanted to be a bus driver. 

I still want to be an astronaut

I wanted to be a garbage man, simply because they got to ride on the back of the trucks. 

And Emma Watson would be absolutely run through by now

I wanted to be a sprinkler. 

No we wouldn&#39;t have a surplus, we just employ a small number because we have a surplus of people trying to be cunts
/S

And not a rocket would catch fire on planet earth.. for very long.

You forgot the ballerinas.  Shitloads of ballerinas.

You can never have enough astronauts, the more you have the more highly risky manned missions to other planets you can attempt.

Consequently we would no longer have a shortage of men
Nor engineers and physicists and movers and construction workers due to overflow sideways

Delending on the age, id be an archeologist, engineer, then super villain.

And pilots , don&#39;t forget pilots

And garbage men!

Would we though? When was the last time you heard a kid saying they want to be an astronaut or a firefighter? Mostly I hear kids saying they want to be youtubers

I wanted to be Cop, then a scientist, then a writer, then a youtuber, then a singer, then a pianist, then a  Stalin, then a Musk..(I skipped lot of tv show mains like Ben 10,Kakashi Hatake, Light Yagamj, etc) 

Meaning that firefighters and astronauts would become a low paid job that no one would want to do and around around around it goes! 

I thought most kids wanted to be football and basketball players

I wanted to have a chance.

Well, I&#39;d be a ninja right now.

Not more than engineers though.

And cowboys smh

And garbage collectors.

This would be a good writing prompt. Just imagine a society where every single person is able to achieve the job of their dreams, how would it function?

If I never knew what I wanted to be, does that mean I would be stuck in limbo?

Kids these days want to become Logan Paul

When I was little, I wanted (still do actually, just never followed it) to be an orchestra conductor. Unfortunately, there are lots of cool career paths I wish I&#39;d followed, and now at 21 I feel like I&#39;m starting too late to change what I&#39;m doing, but I almost still haven&#39;t picked anything yet.

I‚Äôve just seen this! At 31 I retrained to do the job of my dreams - theatre tech. Made enough money to pay off my debts and realised it wasn‚Äôt for me. At 36 I‚Äôm retraining as a school teacher - it really IS for me.
My friend who builds bridges retrained at 28.
My friend who runs his own IT company was a doctor‚Äôs receptionist until he was 30.

i wanted to be a carpenter like my dad

Well, I don&#39;t know about firefighters and astronauts.   I really wanted to drive a garbage truck.  Sadly, I did not achieve my dream.  

Always room for more firefighters

And the problem iiiis?

I wanted to work at the cash register at a local supermarket, because I thought they could keep all the money. That‚Äôs when I first learned the term ‚Äúboss‚Äù.

5 yr old me wanted to be a live theater actress. Adult me is so glad not to do that for a job.

I wanted to be a pilot, paleontologist and lego designer. I still want to be a lego designer.

And veterinarians...gave that one up when I realized part of the job is putting animals down :(

I always wanted to be a construction worker as a kid... yeah.

Not true my brother in law wanted to be a garbage man. Never quite achieved that he became a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù...so much for follow your dreams 

Well I wanted to be a superhero. Unrealistic sure, but I&#39;m the one with superpowers now, not you. Your argument is invalid

And Power Rangers.

I wanted to be a scientist, now Im a mechanical engineer. Pretty close

&quot;Why are there 16 presidents dad&quot;?&quot;Because in America you can be what you want if you beg hard enough, that why I&#39;m an astronaut&quot;.

What&#39;s the difference between kids and firefighters?Kids grow up.

Not me.  I‚Äôd be a doctor/fighter pilot/race car driver/pussy slayer.  
1 out of 4 ain‚Äôt bad. 

so you kill cats? dick.

Not quite.  Your mother can fill you in üëç

You get off on killin cats ya donkey..?
