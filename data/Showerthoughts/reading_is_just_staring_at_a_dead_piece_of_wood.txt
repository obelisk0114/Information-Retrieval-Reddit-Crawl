What? No it&#39;s not. Unless the book is blank or you looked up and actually saw or heard what was happening.

Jokes on you, I read ebooks.

Ahhhhhhh, then you&#39;re staring at ancient sunlight captured by plants and stored in their collective biomass as chemical energy, to be converted into coal as the ages wore on, and then dug up in the present, burned to convert that captured sunlight into thermal energy, in turn used to boil steam as mechanical energy, then converted into electrical energy as it powers magnetic turbines, only to once more be converted into chemical energy in your device&#39;s lithium-ion battery, to once again be converted into liight energy as it powers the screen.

Unless the electricity comes from elsewhere. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s nuclear power: electricity converted from the energy of radioactive fission within uranium metal, which was extracted from minerals deep within the earth, the uranium ultimately transmuted from baser elements within a supernova explosion

The sun is just a giant nuclear reactor

You take really long showers...

Well when you only take one a month you have to make it count 


Skitterkids     Sun Feb 4 21:42:14 2018 UTC

It’s guided hallucination...

Don&#39;t forget the magical incantations you mutter in your head to cause those hallucinations.
