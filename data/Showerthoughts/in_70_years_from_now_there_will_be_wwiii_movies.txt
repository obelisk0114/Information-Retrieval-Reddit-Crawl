I doubt there would be movies or Oscars if there was a WWIII.

Instead of actors playing young daring soldiers and pilots it will be fat old guys pressing big red buttons and comparing dick sizes over Twitter.

imho this is gold worthy man , but im broke tho..

Very precise - when are you anticipating WWIII?


Onedumbman     Sun Feb 4 21:49:12 2018 UTC

I know it takes a lot of things happening for a WW to happen but , call me ignorant if it doesn&#39;t feel like this is the close we have been since 1960s (according to my granpa)

We&#39;re no where near close no matter how much the msm will have you believe it


InstantUbik     Sun Feb 4 21:54:26 2018 UTC

To be honest I&#39;m not sure we could have another world war in the same way anymore. In the words of Einstein: “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”

Aren’t we like 2 minutes to midnight at this point?


TeaAndCrumpetGhoul     Sun Feb 4 21:43:03 2018 UTC

Oscars will be made redundant by then


bertnod     Sun Feb 4 21:43:30 2018 UTC

Thats if were not nuked back to the stone ages


Onedumbman     Sun Feb 4 21:45:05 2018 UTC

True..


samanandatha     Sun Feb 4 21:55:27 2018 UTC

I really hope not. 


noolesscluebie     Sun Feb 4 22:13:41 2018 UTC

Oscars for Shadow Puppets on Cave walls?


Spock_Savage     Sun Feb 4 22:21:53 2018 UTC

Another World War isn&#39;t really possible.
The US is too strong, and the only possible opposition would be North Korea, Iran, and maybe Russia.
Even a nuclear Holocaust isn&#39;t likely, biological warfare from terrorist is the thing we&#39;re probably going to face in the coming decades.

They&#39;ll be chiseled onto stone tablets.
