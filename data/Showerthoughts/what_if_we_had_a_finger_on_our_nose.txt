Just a single pointer finger on the tip of our nose. Imagine wanting to use your phone, but both your hands are busy. You could just use your nose finger

Even without a finger on my nose this is what i do when my hands are both occupied

Yeah me too. It would make nose fingering a lot easier if we had an actual nose finger
