Fire is being used as an adjective. There is no &#39;water&#39; form of speech that is an adjective.  The word is wet.

Cue the “Is Water Wet” argument.

If water is on them, they are under water

Well, no...water can be on you, even if you are not in the water.
Water just doesn’t cause tissue damage by mere contact, like fire does. Water has to get between you and your source of gaseous oxygen to hurt you.

Exactly

They could be “burning”.
