The default “Approved” sound makes me think my card was declined everytime I use it

I hate the sound it makes because it always sounds like it was declined and I have a brief moment of panic.

I was in Costco the other day and the machine made a happy sound when it went through!

Many places have already changed the default sound.  Costco is one. A local Chinese supermarket is another though I think it’s because they are using a different system then Veriphone.
