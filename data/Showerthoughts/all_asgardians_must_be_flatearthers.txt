Woah! Sad if you think about it. Existing in 2-D, when 3-D is right there.

Ehhhh, flat earth has nothing to do with 2D

Sure it does. The concept of flat earth exists on the fact that the earth is only a plain, i.e. It seemingly stretches indefinitely. Why did/do people think that the earth was flat despite nature creating everything on it in  three dimensions? Sure, if it were a cube-earth theory, I wouldn&#39;t have bothered, but come on! Why flat?
