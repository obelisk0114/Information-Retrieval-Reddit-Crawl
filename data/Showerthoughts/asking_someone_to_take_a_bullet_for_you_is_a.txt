But what if your back is turned and they see it.  You wouldn&#39;t even know it&#39;s coming


bigpapichulo29     Sat Feb 3 19:09:53 2018 UTC

Then they should push you out of the way 


Kinda_Crazay     Sat Feb 3 19:34:03 2018 UTC

Angles - What if they are 10 feet from the shooter and you are 20 feet.  You would have to go straight into the path of the bullet.  You wouldn&#39;t have time to run the 10 feet to the person and push them out of the way


bigpapichulo29     Sat Feb 3 19:57:10 2018 UTC

Wouldn’t I have to run the 10ft to get in the bullet path though? 


EBannion     Sat Feb 3 21:03:17 2018 UTC

You——————————shooter                      Savior


PyrZern     Sun Feb 4 02:53:02 2018 UTC

... So, push the shooter aside instead .


EBannion     Sun Feb 4 03:00:54 2018 UTC

They are both the same distance away


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 07:46:39 2018 UTC

Which train will reach Moscow first?


EBannion     Sun Feb 4 08:06:38 2018 UTC

Trick question, The Amtrak one will derail.


Kinda_Crazay     Sat Feb 3 23:05:13 2018 UTC

No, you are just a step from the path of the bullet, halfway between the shooter and the guy getting shot.  You take one step to the side and you block it.  


glompunkSM     Sun Feb 4 07:58:27 2018 UTC

Or what if you are tied in place and cannot be moved...


Todd-The-Wraith     Sat Feb 3 21:24:25 2018 UTC

Well also: there’s a decent chance the stupid thing is going to go through them and hit you as well. 
“Thanks for taking that bullet for me mate. I’d hate to die alone.”


billbixbyakahulk     Sat Feb 3 20:40:27 2018 UTC

I&#39;m sure this 80s action movie scenario is a daily concern in the real world.


par5ul1     Sun Feb 4 00:29:22 2018 UTC

Trust me, catching a bullet happens more often than you think. I work special forces and countless times I&#39;ve seen someone catch a bullet. /s


docious     Sat Feb 3 22:57:05 2018 UTC

Asking somebody to take a bullet for you is a non literal request... what... the.... hell are we talking about here?


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 07:47:59 2018 UTC

Have you never seen a movie? Particular an 80&#39;s action movie?


docious     Sun Feb 4 14:54:35 2018 UTC

Lol... ok I’ll bite.  Which one has this?


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 17:19:04 2018 UTC

All of them


docious     Sun Feb 4 17:30:53 2018 UTC

Literally can’t name one


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 17:46:18 2018 UTC

I was just being a dick man, dicks don&#39;t need to back up their statements


bigpapichulo29     Sat Feb 3 23:01:43 2018 UTC

Hey man, you never know when it could turn into a literal request 


docious     Sat Feb 3 23:08:37 2018 UTC

Brb going to go hit two birds with one stone cause I’m an efficient asshole


Melmab     Sat Feb 3 19:22:51 2018 UTC

It&#39;s more about are they willing to stand between you and any harm that may be in your future.


rocker3k     Sat Feb 3 19:09:27 2018 UTC

Human shield.


IsaacPG     Sat Feb 3 19:27:02 2018 UTC

i don’t know, are there scientific studies on this matter?


bigpapichulo29     Sat Feb 3 19:30:57 2018 UTC

Hmmm, I’m not actually sure but you almost have to assume if there is time to jump in front of something there’s time to move out of the way 


IsaacPG     Sat Feb 3 19:34:16 2018 UTC

what if the person who is jumping in front only needs to move 5cm to stop the bullet, but the person getting shot at has to move 3ft.


hoyohai     Sun Feb 4 00:48:21 2018 UTC

A person getting shot at needs to move three feet? What is this bullet? A cannonball?


IsaacPG     Sun Feb 4 08:35:04 2018 UTC

Possibly, i mean, who are we to say?


IsaacPG     Sun Feb 4 08:35:36 2018 UTC

We’re all just figments of thisuniverse, it’s all rhetorical.


yosh4537     Sun Feb 4 00:05:20 2018 UTC

Maybe they’ll jump infront of you before the shooter pulls the trigger...?


MrDuctape     Sun Feb 4 00:39:00 2018 UTC

But what about the guy who is behind that? Won&#39;t do you much good if you push the president out of the way, only to get his wife killed instead. Or, you know, his kids. Or anyone else in general.


Eazy0900     Sun Feb 4 05:19:09 2018 UTC

I&#39;m sure the killer will have more than one bullet and will retain the intent to kill you still. 2 birds 1 stone.


sprice73     Sun Feb 4 07:57:31 2018 UTC

What if you are getting shot in the back? 


VR_is_the_future     Sun Feb 4 10:45:35 2018 UTC

Think about Spock&#39;s speech during the recent Star Trek movie when he&#39;s lecturing Kirk and the nature of the no-win test. It&#39;s a question/test to see how the responder would react, how they think, what they would do given the constraints of the question/test. Of course you can cheat and say something like &quot;I would push us both out of the way&quot;... But that achieves nothing, it just avoids the scenario and the question. Just like life, you can avoid questions, but what do you accomplish?


Cumupin420     Sun Feb 4 16:31:48 2018 UTC

Not if you don&#39;t see it buddy, that&#39;s the point


enesha     Sun Feb 4 16:54:51 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not about jumping in front of a bullet, it&#39;s about being a human shield.  Bullets move to fast to move in front of


thatguysammo     Sun Feb 4 19:36:25 2018 UTC

catching a bullet is the equivalent of having no physical cover to duck behind, so you uss a person as cover instead.
sure you might be able to dodge the first bullet if your lucky, but most guns hold more than one bullet, odds are the second one will be better aimed at exactly where you dodged to.
