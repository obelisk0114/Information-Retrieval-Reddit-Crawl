Because they know gamers are dead inside


nouille07     Sun Feb 4 11:38:35 2018 UTC

Hahaha.... Send help plz 


Mat_Quantum     Sun Feb 4 16:55:17 2018 UTC

Me too thanks


CratedComments     Sun Feb 4 15:54:46 2018 UTC

Not all of us, we have about 65% dead, the other 35% is several subcategories which I won’t list because I’m too lazy ;)


MonsiuerGeneral     Sun Feb 4 18:30:16 2018 UTC

only 65% dead because I didn&#39;t pay for the DLC to unlock the other 35%...


SpencerHayes     Sun Feb 4 22:07:49 2018 UTC

God damn microtransactions


feor1300     Sun Feb 4 20:40:50 2018 UTC

So you&#39;re only <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7qVlNiAYshQ/hqdefault.jpg"><em>mostly</em> dead?</a>


WarKiel     Sun Feb 4 12:24:41 2018 UTC

Indeed. I play games to distract me from how miserable I feel all of the time.


Maulik456     Sun Feb 4 08:05:22 2018 UTC

Lol


normalityisboring     Sun Feb 4 21:23:39 2018 UTC

The only time I&#39;m alive is when I&#39;m playing as someone else so you&#39;re wrong, pal.


eblackham     Sun Feb 4 22:58:33 2018 UTC

False, we have multiple lives.


Bacxaber     Mon Feb 5 00:15:55 2018 UTC

Dead? Hell no, I have health potions.


spacefloatingmonkey     Sun Feb 4 22:56:00 2018 UTC

Savage


xmu806     Sun Feb 4 07:27:47 2018 UTC

Because they want you to associate their products with being happy and healthy and active.


Mister_IR     Sun Feb 4 11:12:03 2018 UTC

Because physical activity does make us happy. Each time we perform exercises in the gym we feel the influx of hormones rewarding us for our hard work.


PM_YOUR_RIG     Sun Feb 4 11:44:21 2018 UTC

So does finishing Super Mario!


Sad_Alpaca     Sun Feb 4 20:50:54 2018 UTC

But what about the countless hours spent grinding it out till the end, for that one happy moment?


Felicitas93     Sun Feb 4 21:04:43 2018 UTC

If you only have one happy moment, you&#39;re doing it wrong 


ConnorWolf121     Mon Feb 5 00:37:03 2018 UTC

I feel pretty happy when I kill a monster in Monster Hunter, and that takes upwards of an hour each (usually mine get down to a half hour or so lately). And there’s plenty to enjoy in that time.


pieonthedonkey     Sun Feb 4 17:56:09 2018 UTC

Isn&#39;t it serotonin and dopamine (chemicals) that get released not hormones?


Mister_IR     Sun Feb 4 19:00:08 2018 UTC

Yeah, I think you are right here. Sorry 


pieonthedonkey     Sun Feb 4 21:54:42 2018 UTC

No problem, mate. It&#39;s just that hormones can have a negative connotation.


CorvoLP     Sun Feb 4 17:41:58 2018 UTC

(serious) physical activity gives me anxiety attacks and makes me stressed to the point that i have to curl up into a ball and try to control my breathing.


isume     Sun Feb 4 18:36:46 2018 UTC

Is it the exercise or the environment? 


CorvoLP     Sun Feb 4 18:38:24 2018 UTC

its the exercise


lukereuter     Sun Feb 4 19:03:11 2018 UTC

Sounds like you have a mental barrier you need to work through 


Slopbotmydop     Sun Feb 4 18:26:33 2018 UTC

I&#39;m not going to pretend I know what I&#39;m talking about but that just sounds like asthma.


CorvoLP     Sun Feb 4 18:28:00 2018 UTC

no i don&#39;t have asthma. just thinking about exercise makes me physically distraught


Yogymbro     Sun Feb 4 22:32:02 2018 UTC

Sounds like something is wrong with your dna


Farobek     Sun Feb 4 23:05:47 2018 UTC

Walking is a physical activity. Does walking give you the aforementioned anxiety?


CorvoLP     Sun Feb 4 23:32:44 2018 UTC

if its a long distance, yes


scurvy4all     Sun Feb 4 07:11:53 2018 UTC

Because people who hike have more money. They have more money because they didn&#39;t spend it on video games.
/s


jerrie86     Sun Feb 4 07:44:32 2018 UTC

Or they broke after paying for those nice DLC&#39;s. 


ck_9900     Sun Feb 4 12:37:30 2018 UTC

At least they end up with a sense of pride and accomplishment


pm_me_ur_wrasse     Sun Feb 4 16:31:41 2018 UTC

no we dont hiking shit is expensive


Kasoni     Sun Feb 4 16:32:40 2018 UTC

When I went hiking it was because I had no money and couldn&#39;t buy any games.


original_4degrees     Sun Feb 4 07:41:04 2018 UTC

have you seen park fees these days?
/s


Scullvine     Sun Feb 4 09:44:50 2018 UTC

No /s needed. Pretty much the only hiking trail near me wanted an arm and a leg for an overnight primitive campground when no one else was there and no one was expected to arrive.


Irdna     Sun Feb 4 16:04:44 2018 UTC

Gotta be hard to hike with just one Arm and Leg.


Scullvine     Sun Feb 4 18:00:44 2018 UTC

It was no walk in the park, I&#39;ll tell you that much.


mylesfrost335     Sun Feb 4 17:05:43 2018 UTC

No i haven&#39;t had time to leave my dimly lit bedroom. Are they bad? :)


just_read_my_comment     Sun Feb 4 12:19:56 2018 UTC

Because really they should show people boning but that would just be porn.


xXImmortalFoXx     Sun Feb 4 18:51:15 2018 UTC

Because playing video games endlessly isn&#39;t fun, it just fills the void in your soul.


dogecorn     Sun Feb 4 23:32:52 2018 UTC

Haha me too thanks


FriedMackerel     Sun Feb 4 11:58:16 2018 UTC

If no, there’s your answer.

IzarkKiaTarj     Sun Feb 4 19:46:40 2018 UTC

I&#39;m significantly more happy playing a video game than I am hiking. I&#39;m not really sure why you&#39;d think someone was lying about that.


CommentumNonSequiter     Sun Feb 4 19:51:37 2018 UTC

So am I....is called a joke, fren 


Luccacalu     Sun Feb 4 18:37:27 2018 UTC

LeverShan     Sun Feb 4 07:41:22 2018 UTC

Or reading reddit.


Maulik456     Sun Feb 4 08:05:33 2018 UTC

True


tmierz     Sun Feb 4 12:25:30 2018 UTC

Why don&#39;t they show people who get themselves drunk unconscious in shit hole bars?


Anglorified-Honky     Sun Feb 4 18:08:59 2018 UTC

The closest to that you&#39;ll get is a diverse group of friends in thier early 20&#39;s running around in a field or on a beach with Bud light in a cooler nearby.


--yourmum--     Sun Feb 4 19:43:49 2018 UTC

You forgot falling over each other and drifting in and out of slow motion. 


tmierz     Sun Feb 4 22:02:12 2018 UTC

Not even close to what had in mind. Like real shit hole with cheap beer and strippers (also cheap but surprisingly good-looking).


Anglorified-Honky     Mon Feb 5 00:14:46 2018 UTC

You&#39;re right.  It&#39;s not very close to what you want.  But, you&#39;ll never see that.  That was the point.


stormtrooper412     Sun Feb 4 15:34:03 2018 UTC

because hiking gear shops can&#39;t profit off gamers


gerry_mandering_50     Sun Feb 4 23:13:42 2018 UTC

gamers actually can and do wear hiking clothes and boots
The shop&#39;s profit doesn&#39;t come from the actual hiking part, ya know?


MisterB78     Sun Feb 4 15:53:28 2018 UTC

Really they should show masturbating...


Bertha_QuetzalRider     Sun Feb 4 20:39:22 2018 UTC

Because the actual message is, &quot;Do what makes you happy... as long as it&#39;s socially acceptable.&quot;


mhol7597     Sun Feb 4 18:03:03 2018 UTC

Because being genuinely happy cant be dependent on what other people can provide to you 


cxkt     Sun Feb 4 19:29:30 2018 UTC

Yeah, just for once I want that caption under the photo of someone devouring an extra large pizza by themselves while binge-watching stranger things. 


_ripa_     Sun Feb 4 19:37:56 2018 UTC

It&#39;s also funny how all those hiking and other physical activity commercials are beer commercials. 


AStrangeBrew     Sun Feb 4 19:52:34 2018 UTC

Because they usually aren&#39;t marketed towards people who play games all day. A family happily hiking is more appealing to people who don&#39;t give a shit about games than some dude by himself with a focused face, occasionally smiling, staring at a computer screen.


DerpTheTerrible     Sun Feb 4 22:52:48 2018 UTC

Because they know the gamers are more likely to have adblockers installed. 


SicilianFork     Sun Feb 4 21:41:42 2018 UTC

<em>Gets intimidated by post</em>
<em>Proceeds to turn on all the lights</em>
<em>Continues playing 5 games at once</em>


wrooomwrooomwrooom     Sun Feb 4 22:34:07 2018 UTC

Because most people who work in advertising are stupid as shit. Also, they want to travel to nice places with good weather, instead of filming inside, which you could do anywhere (most likely your hometown).
Source: work in advertising 


ThatRandomGuy1011     Sun Feb 4 13:33:27 2018 UTC

That&#39;s deep.


mkmlls743     Sun Feb 4 13:57:52 2018 UTC

We evolved to become healthier when we use are bodies. The healthier you are the happier you can be. When video games become physically active then we will see nothing but virtual reality commercials and slogans. 


spaceraverdk     Sun Feb 4 16:08:44 2018 UTC

Vr gaming.. 


14489553421138532110     Sun Feb 4 12:19:33 2018 UTC

Because people don&#39;t inherently understand that different people enjoy doing different things. It&#39;s like how society stereotypes people who enjoy anime and video games as &#39;losers&#39;.


Wavearsenal333     Sun Feb 4 14:14:55 2018 UTC

Stereotypes? From experience I&#39;d honestly say it&#39;s pretty accurate. 


14489553421138532110     Sun Feb 4 14:26:34 2018 UTC

Whatever helps you sleep at night :)


Wavearsenal333     Sun Feb 4 15:11:48 2018 UTC

What helps me sleep at night is NOT jerking it to tentacle porn


14489553421138532110     Sun Feb 4 15:25:41 2018 UTC

Because that&#39;s what the majority of anime is all about.


Wavearsenal333     Sun Feb 4 15:28:53 2018 UTC

I know


StevenCai69     Sun Feb 4 18:03:36 2018 UTC

So you think people who watch anime and play video games are &quot;losers&quot;? wow.....


furrthur     Sun Feb 4 21:48:32 2018 UTC

They targeted gamers.
Gamers.
We&#39;re a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.
We&#39;ll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it&#39;s fun.
We&#39;ll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We&#39;re already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren&#39;t shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We&#39;ve been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that&#39;s already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they&#39;ve threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can&#39;t is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You&#39;re not special, you&#39;re not original, you&#39;re not the first; this is just another boss fight.


blazemaster9210     Sun Feb 4 20:25:49 2018 UTC

Actually, video game players have closer to a 50% win rate, which some being somewhat below in the near 40&#39;s, and with some above in the 60&#39;s-70&#39;s. That makes them <em>not</em> losers a lot of the time. 
With anime, you get to watch a nice piece of art (mostly, there&#39;s some real crap out there) unfold and enjoy the results of someone&#39;s hard work, just as one would enjoy a book, a movie, or a <em>television show.</em>


SomeGoodInThisWorld     Sun Feb 4 10:57:24 2018 UTC

Yeah I know, another form of prejudice, it&#39;s a safe bet for people think they &quot;ought&quot; to do, not what they actually like to do with their free time


munchiesssss     Sun Feb 4 14:28:51 2018 UTC

Being in nature and getting excercise produces real forms of well being. They&#39;re not gonna show video games just because it dumps your dopamine receptors like meth lmao


Vistas_     Sun Feb 4 19:34:44 2018 UTC

Thanks for articulating this, it&#39;s my entire problem with this thread 


the_original_Retro     Sun Feb 4 07:48:22 2018 UTC

It&#39;s a piece of trite advice from a long time ago. Someone appropriated it for a marketing slogan hoping to capitalize on the feels.


AStrangeBrew     Sun Feb 4 19:55:53 2018 UTC

Usually used with medicine commercials. &quot;Take <em>our medicine</em> and get back out to doing what makes you happy!&quot; (shows a happy family hiking in the woods.) 
They aren&#39;t just putting out a feel good message, it&#39;s marketing.


Wavearsenal333     Sun Feb 4 14:12:09 2018 UTC

Or meddling in the affairs of coworkers and spreading vicious rumors. 


nate725     Sun Feb 4 16:52:01 2018 UTC

The fact that this bothered you to the point of taking the time to write it in here shows about how happy you must be... 


rhaizee     Sun Feb 4 18:16:14 2018 UTC

More about being out and about and being free to go wherever and do whatever than it is about being physically hiking.


deadlyrabbits     Sun Feb 4 19:43:00 2018 UTC

Or getting a blowjob in the back room at a strip joint.


RichardSmith2020     Sun Feb 4 19:48:32 2018 UTC

nikkikikkertje     Sun Feb 4 21:46:56 2018 UTC

Yogymbro     Sun Feb 4 22:31:18 2018 UTC

Because sunlight and exercise are medically proven to make people happy?


raygundan     Sun Feb 4 22:52:21 2018 UTC

Because sitting in a dimly-lit room endlessly making commercials full of people hiking makes them happy.


Stolypin26     Sun Feb 4 23:32:52 2018 UTC

Do they play games about other people playing games? Of course not. They play games about people who go out and do things. This is because that&#39;s what everybody wants to do but either they don&#39;t have the time or the energy.


pastrydoctor     Sun Feb 4 23:39:23 2018 UTC

They don’t want to show the truth 


iToaditSo     Sun Feb 4 23:45:27 2018 UTC

The people hiking and doing physical stuff is saved for the herpes commercials. They make it seem like life begins after herpes lol


Kwantuum     Mon Feb 5 00:39:12 2018 UTC

because playing video games makes you content, not happy.


PM_ME_YO_GAMS_GIRL     Mon Feb 5 01:06:51 2018 UTC

Because people who always play video games for hours on end in dimly lit rooms are usually not mentally healthy human beings. 


mirrorspirit     Mon Feb 5 01:22:21 2018 UTC

Nope. Those are the video games.  Better VR, less chance of injury.


Jagan_Master     Sun Feb 4 15:51:55 2018 UTC

Because physical activities are what makes you happy, and one of the best things in a lifetime.


AStrangeBrew     Sun Feb 4 19:59:12 2018 UTC

I like how this comment is marked as controversial lmao


Jagan_Master     Sun Feb 4 20:38:49 2018 UTC

Lol do the auto-moderators do that?


chefranden     Sun Feb 4 14:54:38 2018 UTC

For the same reason the drunk looks for his keys under the streetlamp, the light is better. 


aRealGoose     Sun Feb 4 15:44:39 2018 UTC

I&#39;m amused that people usually drive to their hiking spot.


NewScooter1234     Sun Feb 4 16:28:26 2018 UTC

The only people who don&#39;t like nature haven&#39;t really gotten the chance to experience it.
Or they grew up in it and being indoors playing games is more novel. 


ptsfn54a     Sun Feb 4 16:58:06 2018 UTC

Because people like to pretend they are better than they really are. Most people don&#39;t post what they really feel or do, they post what they want people to think about them...its all a show, just like Facebook.


AStrangeBrew     Sun Feb 4 20:00:18 2018 UTC

Some people actually hike and get frequent physical activity. 


ApatheticSaiyan     Sun Feb 4 11:58:08 2018 UTC
