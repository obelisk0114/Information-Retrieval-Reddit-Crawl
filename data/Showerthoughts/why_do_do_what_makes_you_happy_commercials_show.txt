Because they know gamers are dead inside

Hahaha.... Send help plz 

Lol

Indeed. I play games to distract me from how miserable I feel all of the time.

Because they want you to associate their products with being happy and healthy and active.

Because people who hike have more money. They have more money because they didn&#39;t spend it on video games.
/s

Or they broke after paying for those nice DLC&#39;s. 

At least they end up with a sense of pride and accomplishment

have you seen park fees these days?
/s

No /s needed. Pretty much the only hiking trail near me wanted an arm and a leg for an overnight primitive campground when no one else was there and no one was expected to arrive.

Yeah I know, another form of prejudice, it&#39;s a safe bet for people think they &quot;ought&quot; to do, not what they actually like to do with their free time

Are you happy?
If no, there’s your answer. 
If yes, <a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/okp66FD" rel="nofollow">https://m.imgur.com/gallery/okp66FD</a>

Or reading reddit.

True

Because physical activity does make us happy. Each time we perform exercises in the gym we feel the influx of hormones rewarding us for our hard work.

So does finishing Super Mario!

Why don&#39;t they show people who get themselves drunk unconscious in shit hole bars?

Commercials are meant to get you to spend money.

Because most people who sit in dark rooms alone playing video games endlessly aren&#39;t actually happy.

That&#39;s deep.

What the fuck is a “do what makes you happy” commercial? Why would somebody spend money to advertise that?

It&#39;s a piece of trite advice from a long time ago. Someone appropriated it for a marketing slogan hoping to capitalize on the feels.

Because really they should show people boning but that would just be porn.

We evolved to become healthier when we use are bodies. The healthier you are the happier you can be. When video games become physically active then we will see nothing but virtual reality commercials and slogans. 

Because people don&#39;t inherently understand that different people enjoy doing different things. It&#39;s like how society stereotypes people who enjoy anime and video games as &#39;losers&#39;.

Commercial?
