True. I watch Daria and I&#39;m like &#39;fuck, you have great parents who love you, a gorgeous home, worried about nothing and appreciate nothing.&#39;  Drives me insane.

Here in Canada, or at least in Ontario. Teachers are over paid and most don&#39;t do any extracurricular&#39;s for their students. I definitely can&#39;t sympathize with teachers in media.
