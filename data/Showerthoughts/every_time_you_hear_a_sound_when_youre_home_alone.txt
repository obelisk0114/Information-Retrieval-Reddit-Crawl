I hate you. 


Jagan_Master     Sun Feb 4 00:11:36 2018 UTC

I was fucking just about to comment the exact same thing. But as a joke.


CaioNV     Sun Feb 4 01:47:34 2018 UTC

I was about to comment &quot;I hate you so much&quot;, can I join this club?
Topic creator, I hate you so much.

The people who got off their butts to &quot;check it out&quot; usually surprise the culprit and get murdered anyway. No thanks. If I&#39;m gonna die, I&#39;m gonna die caked in potato chip crumbs binge watching anime on Netflix.


S0ulsOfTh3D6mned     Sun Feb 4 02:36:59 2018 UTC

Get VRV. You not only get stuff from crunchy roll but funimation and others too


CanBurgersSwim     Sat Feb 3 22:06:18 2018 UTC

Anime? On Netflix? Ha, maybe a great while ago. Now it&#39;s just Netflix Original trash.

Netflix is absolute shit, none of their originals are good except for master of none, then again it was written by someone else 


MrBlackadder     Sun Feb 4 00:31:19 2018 UTC

I think thatâ€™s a pretty bad generalisation, there are plenty of excellent Netflix Originals; House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, The Crown, the list goes on.


DynamiteG     Sun Feb 4 04:48:09 2018 UTC

how do you not include bojack?


MrBlackadder     Sun Feb 4 05:14:37 2018 UTC

I will not swear to the quality of a show which I have not seen, Ser.


DynamiteG     Sun Feb 4 06:02:19 2018 UTC

you have to watch it. an amazing show. highly recommend it!


AK47Akash     Sun Feb 4 00:49:00 2018 UTC

Imo I don&#39;t like them because they would be interesting for like the first season, but quickly became uninteresting


tivinho99     Sat Feb 3 23:28:30 2018 UTC

Home alone , in the bathroom , i heard some noises outside 2m ago...


Tophertanium     Sun Feb 4 00:38:24 2018 UTC

Itâ€™s been an hour. Are you okay?


SergioGMika     Sun Feb 4 03:01:34 2018 UTC

He says he is ok, don&#39;t worry about it, move on, carry on...


lady_laughs_too_much     Sun Feb 4 03:18:03 2018 UTC

That&#39;s what the serial killer hiding in his shower would say...


SergioGMika     Sun Feb 4 03:18:49 2018 UTC

I probably would have said something more li....Ah shit!


Speedswiper     Sat Feb 3 23:54:52 2018 UTC

And then billions more were fine.


LasDen     Sun Feb 4 00:22:51 2018 UTC

I live in an apartment and in my room you can hear water moving in the pipes. And few days ago after I went to sleep, for some reason after hearing the water, heat moving up and down I thought to myself that it sounds like whispering. After that I was so freaked out and cursed myself for thinking this... 


EarthHatingAlien     Sun Feb 4 00:56:23 2018 UTC

I&#39;m home alone and I did hear a noice but I&#39;m so tired today I can&#39;t even be bothered. If it&#39;s nothing then I&#39;m not getting out of bed for no reason. If there&#39;s a murderer, well at least I won&#39;t be so tired anymore


femmestem     Sun Feb 4 07:26:31 2018 UTC

You&#39;re the worst. I&#39;ve literally met every person on the planet and determined you to be the worst one of them.

&quot;Not all bullets&quot; - your local democrat 2018


Dr_Mr_Jeff     Sun Feb 4 01:55:05 2018 UTC

Hey the bullet canâ€™t because itâ€™s not sentient. Unless of course you draw a face on it. Then itâ€™s always the bullets fault


chris_af     Sat Feb 3 18:03:16 2018 UTC

I donâ€™t always upvote <a href="/r/showerthoughts">r/showerthoughts</a>, but when I do I always remember how the bot tells me my attempts werenâ€™t good enough for the sub. 


munchiesssss     Sun Feb 4 03:40:09 2018 UTC

That was my thought exactly lol. This isnt a shower thought


vzmeister     Sat Feb 3 18:31:29 2018 UTC

So in the end it was fine, right?


assman456     Sat Feb 3 19:11:15 2018 UTC

I always hated the people in the movies who would go check if they heard a sound in their house, but lately Iâ€™ve been finding myself doing it a lot.


loveslaughs     Sun Feb 4 01:25:42 2018 UTC

Thanks for that


Lyoko_warrior95     Sun Feb 4 07:02:12 2018 UTC

Itâ€™s alright. I donâ€™t need to sleep anyway. Itâ€™s not like I have to be at work at 7AM to open my store or anything.. ðŸ™ƒ

There&#39;s nothing quite as peaceful as falling asleep on a Sunday night and hearing that sounds as you drift off and silently hope you never have to face another Monday again.
