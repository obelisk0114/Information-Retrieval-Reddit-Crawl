Actually it’s only the male mosquito that makes that annoying noise. And it’s the female that bites and sucks blood. So the ones you can hear that are harmless. It’s the quiet ones you’ve got to watch out for. Females wings are larger and therefore have a much quieter flap than the smaller winged male mosquitoes.

It&#39;s not even about the noise. They&#39;d be better off if their bites did&#39;t cause so much discomfort.
