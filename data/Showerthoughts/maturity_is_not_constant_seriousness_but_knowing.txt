But what about when you <em>know</em> not to be silly, but you still are? 


thwinks     Sat Feb 3 18:39:08 2018 UTC

That&#39;s called &quot;comedic timing&quot;


Ta2whitey     Sun Feb 4 00:04:37 2018 UTC

If people have a sense of humor.


Rickrickrickrickrick     Sun Feb 4 00:40:13 2018 UTC

Like when I make necrophilia jokes at my mom&#39;s funeral. Fucking stuck up no sense of humor having people don&#39;t laugh and just get angfry with me. I hate when people aren&#39;t as mature as I am.


Ta2whitey     Sun Feb 4 01:42:42 2018 UTC

exactly the situation I was thinking of

leopardspot_polkadot     Sun Feb 4 00:03:00 2018 UTC

That&#39;s called not giving a fuck.


LordSqweb     Sun Feb 4 01:32:28 2018 UTC

That&#39;s being selfish and inconsiderate. Or hilarious. Depends on the situation. 


radomunkownperson     Sun Feb 4 00:18:45 2018 UTC

Psychopathic tendencies, I guess


LaserfaceJones     Sat Feb 3 22:35:22 2018 UTC

It&#39;s also the ability to deal with shit not going your way. Seems like a lot of people could take that a bit more to heart.


rossimus     Sat Feb 3 23:55:17 2018 UTC

I needed to read this today.  Cheers.


Shippoyasha     Sun Feb 4 05:34:27 2018 UTC

Sadly I deal with a manic mother who just loses her cool and lashes out everyone once one thing goes wrong and makes a huge mountain out of a molehill. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a psychological condition at this point. It goes beyond just a little misdirection in attitude. 


RidgeBoyGenius     Sat Feb 3 23:40:58 2018 UTC

I believe maturity is when you are able to decide to do something that may not give you short term happiness because you know it is right for you in the long run.


Palvinist99     Sat Feb 3 23:53:11 2018 UTC

Definitely a sign of maturity.


wickedsteve     Sun Feb 4 00:40:19 2018 UTC

Maturity is not being a baby after anything you decide gets fucked up.


juzz85     Sun Feb 4 09:53:11 2018 UTC

I&#39;d say that&#39;s discipline..which takes maturity i guess.


iHOPEimNOTanNPC     Sat Feb 3 21:50:18 2018 UTC

There is no such thing as being an adult. We‚Äôre all just kids just some of us have more responsibilities than others lol.

&quot;Growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional.&quot;


Gunsgolf     Sun Feb 4 05:43:56 2018 UTC

Maturity is knowing when to act a certain way and not be an annoyance to others around you, while being responsible is making right choices that will possibly help you in the future and lead you towards success.

Shut up, muffin.


emtwo1950     Sat Feb 3 22:20:17 2018 UTC

Kurt Vonnegut Jr. has one of my favorite quotes about maturity. If I remember correctly, it appears in his novel, <em>Slapstick.</em>
<em>&quot;Maturity is a bitter disappointment for which there is no remedy, unless laughter can be said to cure anything.&quot;</em>
In other words, &quot;maturity&quot; is just a euphamism for being humorless, and we could all benefit from taking ourselves less seriously and having a good laugh every now and then.


Palvinist99     Sat Feb 3 23:17:54 2018 UTC

Yeah I reject that definition. I think maturity is the discernment to know when it&#39;s appropriate to be serious and when its appropriate not to be.


Cherub_Chubbs     Sat Feb 3 23:58:48 2018 UTC

I think both descriptions are applicable to life, and in fact compliment each other. One can know when to be serious, in other words to live humorlessly, and that knowing when to be, and being, humorous and in some sense, childish, can be seen as an alleviation from the humorless maturity one shows the rest of the time. You can live humorlessly, maturely, and be humorous at the right times to relieve yourself from the the maturity you show the rest of the time. 


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 00:06:33 2018 UTC

Op is saying that is a part of being mature. You can be mature without being humorless.


Cherub_Chubbs     Sun Feb 4 00:09:02 2018 UTC

Ah... I see that now. Text can be misinterpreted, but now op‚Äôs message is much clearer, thank you. 


Rx710     Sun Feb 4 00:12:51 2018 UTC

No problem! Have a good one


Cherub_Chubbs     Sun Feb 4 00:17:58 2018 UTC

You too!


emtwo1950     Sun Feb 4 00:48:01 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t think KV would necessarily disagree with you. There is, I believe, an inherent implication that often times you have no choice but to be serious.
However, when you do have a choice, enjoying yourself is much more fulfilling than stoicism for its own sake.


juzz85     Sun Feb 4 10:02:13 2018 UTC

Absolutely you can laugh and still be mature jesus they make it sound so mobid.


TheRadiantDehd     Sat Feb 3 18:28:05 2018 UTC

I&#39;m fine with growing old, but I&#39;m sure as heck never gonna grow up. üòÅ

Yeah, as he said, he isn‚Äôt grown up yet, so no using adult words yet.

rossimus     Sat Feb 3 23:55:56 2018 UTC

Growing old is inevitable.  Growing up is optional.


Shitty-Coriolis     Sat Feb 3 22:50:54 2018 UTC

Maturity is not related to being serious at all. 


ndoubt     Sun Feb 4 08:58:52 2018 UTC

Agree. Introverted smart kids know when not to be stupid even when they&#39;re in kindergarten, but you wouldn&#39;t call them mature just for that.  To me taking full responsibility for one&#39;s actions instead of blaming others is a main sign of maturity, so it&#39;s just sad when people can&#39;t accept the fact that their sad life is screwed up because of their stupid decisions. People can always choose even when they don&#39;t like the options. 


cmagnificent     Sun Feb 4 00:40:40 2018 UTC

To me, the biggest mark of maturity is when you finally come to terms with the fact that there are plenty of situations where there isn&#39;t a correct answer, but you have to make a choice anyway.


reitau     Sat Feb 3 22:43:12 2018 UTC

This is like validation for me - I often regret or feel bad about jokes at work - in a middle Manager I guess so I think about promotion etc and think my wit would get in my way to move up the chain 


Shitty-Coriolis     Sat Feb 3 22:51:42 2018 UTC

Its okay, Michael. We understand.

topgirlaurora     Sun Feb 4 00:28:49 2018 UTC

The day I knew I was an adult was the day I put someone else&#39;s well-being over my short-term happiness.
I was sick one winter day -think I had a cold- and boredom and loneliness kicked in. My best friend called, asking if I wanted to hang out. I would have loved her company, but she&#39;s got a weak immune system and is allergic to most common medications. So, concerned for her, I told her I didn&#39;t want to get her sick.
Ever since, that&#39;s been my defining, &quot;I am not a kid anymore&quot; example.


Powderbones     Sun Feb 4 02:01:23 2018 UTC

You don&#39;t stop laughing when you get older. You get older when you stop laughing...


_paddy_     Sun Feb 4 09:15:48 2018 UTC

Thanks for letting me know that I might actually be mature!:-)

Seriousness is an illness !!


Darke427     Sun Feb 4 00:55:19 2018 UTC

Can a man still be serious if he&#39;s silly?
That is the only time a man can be serious.


LordBaconofHashbrown     Sun Feb 4 01:57:40 2018 UTC

You know, this thread just made me realize how much I use being silly as a coping mechanism for dealing with my anxiety problems.

Life is too important be taken seriously.                      Oscar Wilde

I thought that was obvious.


Hashbaz     Sun Feb 4 06:51:43 2018 UTC

The only difference between children and adults is responsibility.

And how to be silly


Jeuscifer     Sun Feb 4 11:26:13 2018 UTC

I think it&#39;s also knowing when to let go and be silly, not always for yourself but because everyone else might need it; they want to see you have a good time.

Read the post title. Now read my first comment. You‚Äôll understand sarcasm now. 


DJExxx     Sun Feb 4 00:38:24 2018 UTC

My daughter 8 recently turned to me and said ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt wait to be an adult like you‚Äô to which I replied ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not really an adult, I just pretend!‚Äô. 


hopefulbot     Sat Feb 3 18:29:10 2018 UTC

To loosely translate does this mean Maturity is fluctuating seriousness and knowing when to be silly?


AsleepCorgi     Sat Feb 3 18:58:25 2018 UTC
