But what about when you <em>know</em> not to be silly, but you still are? 

That&#39;s called &quot;comedic timing&quot;

If people have a sense of humor.

Like when I make necrophilia jokes at my mom&#39;s funeral. Fucking stuck up no sense of humor having people don&#39;t laugh and just get angfry with me. I hate when people aren&#39;t as mature as I am.

exactly the situation I was thinking of 

This joke is as dead as your mothers

Stirring the pot 

Shit stirrer

That&#39;s called not giving a fuck.

That&#39;s being selfish and inconsiderate. Or hilarious. Depends on the situation. 

Psychopathic tendencies, I guess

It&#39;s also the ability to deal with shit not going your way. Seems like a lot of people could take that a bit more to heart.

I needed to read this today.  Cheers.

Sadly I deal with a manic mother who just loses her cool and lashes out everyone once one thing goes wrong and makes a huge mountain out of a molehill. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a psychological condition at this point. It goes beyond just a little misdirection in attitude. 

I believe maturity is when you are able to decide to do something that may not give you short term happiness because you know it is right for you in the long run.

Definitely a sign of maturity.

Maturity is not being a baby after anything you decide gets fucked up.

I&#39;d say that&#39;s discipline..which takes maturity i guess.

There is no such thing as being an adult. We‚Äôre all just kids just some of us have more responsibilities than others lol.

There not their.
Sorry just wanted to point that out.
Their indicates someone&#39;s property.

This guy adults. 

This guy acknowledges.

This guy chains.

This guy know.

This guy

This

I will never not reblog this XD rawr

&quot;Growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional.&quot;

Maturity is knowing when to act a certain way and not be an annoyance to others around you, while being responsible is making right choices that will possibly help you in the future and lead you towards success.

We‚Äôre all just kids 
Speak only for yourself.

Ooh, look at Mr. Fancy Not-A-Kid

I&#39;m all just kids

I am ALL kids on this blessed day.

Please enlighten us with what makes you so much more adult than the rest of us?

Shut up, muffin.

Kurt Vonnegut Jr. has one of my favorite quotes about maturity. If I remember correctly, it appears in his novel, <em>Slapstick.</em>
<em>&quot;Maturity is a bitter disappointment for which there is no remedy, unless laughter can be said to cure anything.&quot;</em>
In other words, &quot;maturity&quot; is just a euphamism for being humorless, and we could all benefit from taking ourselves less seriously and having a good laugh every now and then.

Yeah I reject that definition. I think maturity is the discernment to know when it&#39;s appropriate to be serious and when its appropriate not to be.

I think both descriptions are applicable to life, and in fact compliment each other. One can know when to be serious, in other words to live humorlessly, and that knowing when to be, and being, humorous and in some sense, childish, can be seen as an alleviation from the humorless maturity one shows the rest of the time. You can live humorlessly, maturely, and be humorous at the right times to relieve yourself from the the maturity you show the rest of the time. 

Op is saying that is a part of being mature. You can be mature without being humorless.

Ah... I see that now. Text can be misinterpreted, but now op‚Äôs message is much clearer, thank you. 

No problem! Have a good one

You too!

I don&#39;t think KV would necessarily disagree with you. There is, I believe, an inherent implication that often times you have no choice but to be serious.
However, when you do have a choice, enjoying yourself is much more fulfilling than stoicism for its own sake.

Absolutely you can laugh and still be mature jesus they make it sound so mobid.

I&#39;m fine with growing old, but I&#39;m sure as heck never gonna grow up. üòÅ

Sure as heck
Easy there sailor

Sorry. Sure as f&amp;$k. We all good? üòÇ

That&#39;s more like it

Yeah, as he said, he isn‚Äôt grown up yet, so no using adult words yet.  

*fuck

Growing old is inevitable.  Growing up is optional.

Maturity is not related to being serious at all. 

Agree. Introverted smart kids know when not to be stupid even when they&#39;re in kindergarten, but you wouldn&#39;t call them mature just for that.  To me taking full responsibility for one&#39;s actions instead of blaming others is a main sign of maturity, so it&#39;s just sad when people can&#39;t accept the fact that their sad life is screwed up because of their stupid decisions. People can always choose even when they don&#39;t like the options. 

To me, the biggest mark of maturity is when you finally come to terms with the fact that there are plenty of situations where there isn&#39;t a correct answer, but you have to make a choice anyway.

This is like validation for me - I often regret or feel bad about jokes at work - in a middle Manager I guess so I think about promotion etc and think my wit would get in my way to move up the chain 

Its okay, Michael. We understand.

I‚Äôm never smashed the upvote button so hard!

The day I knew I was an adult was the day I put someone else&#39;s well-being over my short-term happiness.
I was sick one winter day -think I had a cold- and boredom and loneliness kicked in. My best friend called, asking if I wanted to hang out. I would have loved her company, but she&#39;s got a weak immune system and is allergic to most common medications. So, concerned for her, I told her I didn&#39;t want to get her sick.
Ever since, that&#39;s been my defining, &quot;I am not a kid anymore&quot; example.

You don&#39;t stop laughing when you get older. You get older when you stop laughing...

I need this post in my life. Thanks.

Seriousness is an illness !!

Can a man still be serious if he&#39;s silly?
That is the only time a man can be serious.

You know, this thread just made me realize how much I use being silly as a coping mechanism for dealing with my anxiety problems.

Life is too important be taken seriously.                      Oscar Wilde

I thought that was obvious.

The only difference between children and adults is responsibility.

‚ÄúYou can pretend to be serious but you can‚Äôt pretend to be witty.‚Äù‚Äî Sasha Guitry

And how to be silly

Thanks for letting me know that I might actually be mature!:-)

I think it&#39;s also knowing when to let go and be silly, not always for yourself but because everyone else might need it; they want to see you have a good time.

Animals never mature

You ever had a puppy bro?

Read the post title. Now read my first comment. You‚Äôll understand sarcasm now. 

My daughter 8 recently turned to me and said ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt wait to be an adult like you‚Äô to which I replied ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not really an adult, I just pretend!‚Äô. 

To loosely translate does this mean Maturity is fluctuating seriousness and knowing when to be silly?

You literally just restated what OP said

He said it a second time for the people in the back. 

Who&#39;s in a sack?
