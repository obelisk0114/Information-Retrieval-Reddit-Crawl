One refers to how one feels about establishing the national religion and the other refers to being opposed to removing the national religion.  A person who would not vote to initiate a national religion still might not one, once initiated, to be removed.

And then if it were to be removed, and there are people who want it to be re-established, would it be called dis-antidisestablishementarianism?

Reestablishmentarianism would be slightly less cumbersome, I would think.

Ah. Good call. And then?

This is 2 or 3 steps ahead of what my non-caffeined brain can comprehend in this moment.  ._.

Dereestablishmentarianism? Or do you think it would go back to disestablishmentarianism?
