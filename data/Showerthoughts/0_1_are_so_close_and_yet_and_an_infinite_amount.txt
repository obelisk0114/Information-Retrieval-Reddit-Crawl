Conceptually, those are the two numbers that are most far apart. Having 0 of something vs. having 1 of something are the two most different scenarios possible.
0= There is nothing1= There is something! Once this occurs, all other numbers become possible.

Thatâ€™s like saying 1 and 10 are close because they are both on the same number line yet an infinite amount of numbers fall between them also. The infant is to the 10th power.
