Roads and sidewalks don’t usually get slippery when wet - concrete and asphalt are extremely good at absorbing water. 
The reason while ceramic tile and hardwood get slippery when wet is <strong>because</strong> they are hydrophobic in the first place. The water doesn’t absorb into the floor (which would create a nice atmosphere for mold and swelling and a bunch of other fun things). 


revertdata     Sat Feb 3 16:00:43 2018 UTC

does that mean the “concrete” all over my campus isn’t actual concrete? when it rains here, <em>everybody</em> slips at least three times before they make it to the next building 


Suave-Matthews     Sat Feb 3 16:06:02 2018 UTC

Concrete can be sanded and polished. I think it’s a silly process, but I’ve been in a few garages with polished concrete. Slippery af 


iam_a_waterjug     Sat Feb 3 16:40:00 2018 UTC

That&#39;s common in Arizona.


Suave-Matthews     Sat Feb 3 16:45:03 2018 UTC

It works much better there with little rain. Here in Michigan you don’t see it outdoors very often. 
Friend of mine use to have polished concrete around her hot tub. Imagine being drunk and walking on a glass floor smeared with astroglide. 
That’s the best way I can describe polished concrete when wet.

It&#39;s even better on a blow up mattress, like an elevated super slick slip n slide. 


xrblizzardx     Sat Feb 3 17:21:00 2018 UTC

Am also from Michigan. My sister just bought a house with a lot of stamped concrete outside the front door and around back. That stuff wasn’t a great choice for this environment

Could try pressure washing the fuck out of it with the strongest pressure washer you can rent. I can tell you for a fact enough pressure will resurface them.

With how expensive that stuff is I know they don’t want to ruin it for resale value. They don’t play on staying there forever. Good idea for the future though if this problem ever comes up again in a more permanent situation


ladylattemotif     Sat Feb 3 23:28:55 2018 UTC

My mother suffered significant brain damage walking between the hot tub and the bathroom, wet foot on tile floor. She&#39;s now epileptic, cross, and struggles to tell anecdotes. This isn&#39;t worth it -- please consider asking your friend to make a safer compromise.


cubitoaequet     Sat Feb 3 20:55:44 2018 UTC

Someone at my school in Seattle decided that it would be a good idea to polish sections of the concrete outside. Good thing it never rains in Seattle so I never almost break my ass every time I walk between buildings. 


revertdata     Sat Feb 3 16:58:01 2018 UTC

oh yeah we’re about a half hour away from the arizona border so it is <em>that</em> kind of weather. it doesn’t rain much but i walk to and from campus so it sucks when it does
edit: <em>border</em>


rand0mnewb     Sat Feb 3 16:57:09 2018 UTC

Concrete can also be finished super slick and less absorbent if you ask for it. The roughness and absorbance of concrete are entirely up to the guy finishing it, if he knows what he&#39;s doing.


white_android     Sat Feb 3 17:03:01 2018 UTC

Slippery but fun as fuck. Moonwalking. Concrete skating. Ballet. You name it. If you can slide. You can do it. 
Call now!


Jager4TheUndead     Sat Feb 3 16:50:31 2018 UTC

That&#39;s only after they achieve the right finish on the concrete.  Its called a hard trowel fibish.  After the concrete is cured it can be polished


Sanders0492     Sat Feb 3 17:40:47 2018 UTC

Growing up my neighbor had a pool and I remember always running home after swimming and slipping in our garage. I’ve smacked the back of my head many times in that garage. However, it was kinda nice when it was dry. I don’t know why, but when working on my car I preferred the slick garage floor to the rough driveway. Maybe cause it was easier to slide around under my car, idk


Refurbishedcamel     Sat Feb 3 17:14:51 2018 UTC

The shop I work In has this it’s a bitch to clean/walk on if oil gets on it


theMANthatsREDD     Sat Feb 3 21:46:33 2018 UTC

Lol. It is a smooth trowel finish. Sidewalks and roads are finished with a broom to give it texture so people do slip.


Acarlmac     Sat Feb 3 17:40:59 2018 UTC

Is it painted? 


nanoH2O     Sat Feb 3 16:17:01 2018 UTC

Absorption has nothing to do with hydrophobicity. It&#39;s based on relative surface energy. A superhydrophobic floor would be very slippery, yes, but because the adhesive force of water to  the floor is very low, thus it acts as a lubricant. Not because water doesn&#39;t absorb into the structure of the floor.
In fact, OP&#39;s suggestion would work just fine as long as paint is more hydrophobic than flooring. Water will move into lower surface energy area. 


reset_password_     Sat Feb 3 18:24:23 2018 UTC

It&#39;s not a matter of the water moving.  It&#39;s  about color change when wet.


nanoH2O     Sat Feb 3 19:35:45 2018 UTC

Lol, why do you think it changes color?? A material cannot absorb water if it&#39;s hydrophobic. Stop upvoting this person and spreading this utter nonsense 


reset_password_     Sat Feb 3 20:19:23 2018 UTC

This is really the best question. Why do i think <em>what</em> changes color? 


nanoH2O     Sat Feb 3 22:18:56 2018 UTC

Yeah ok, I agree it definitely doesn&#39;t change color, maybe shades is a better description 


reset_password_     Sat Feb 3 14:01:31 2018 UTC

This is the best answer. Concrete and asphalt absorb water pretty well. That&#39;s why they get darker when wet. These surfaces are also slip resistant (concrete with a raked surface, anyway). There&#39;s no need to put warnings on slip resistant surfaces. Slippery surfaces are usually painted with some water resistant coating or are a lowet porous material like polished stone or ceramic tile. The &quot;warning&quot; would be invisible when wet because the slippery surfaces tend not to change color.

Why do surfaces that absorb water get darker when wet?


verylobsterlike     Sat Feb 3 16:24:00 2018 UTC

Much like human skin can absorb sunlight, giving us a sun tan, surfaces that absorb water tend to get a water tan. Just like suntans fade when all the sun has escaped your skin, the sidewalk turns back to its usual color once the water evaporates. Human skin is waterproof, otherwise we&#39;d get water tans too! Although we&#39;d probably also leak blood and other fluids everywhere, so it&#39;s probably a good thing we don&#39;t.

kinda thought we got darker cause the cells were damaged, rather than we&#39;re absorbing sunlight. i mean, we do, in a sense, but the change isn&#39;t from the sunlight absorbed, its uv damage.

That and tile usually gets stripped and a new clear coat put on it. We used to do it once a week at a grocery that I worked at when I was a kid.


goryblasphemy     Sat Feb 3 16:19:15 2018 UTC

Extremely, is probably the wrong word to use, asa concrete surface doesn&#39;t absorb water as well as a sponge


PhDOH     Sat Feb 3 16:38:49 2018 UTC

I hope people don&#39;t start to ignore the highway code and drive with the same amount of gap whether the road is wet or dry because of this; there&#39;s still surface water on the road and there&#39;s a reason you should double your gap to 4 seconds. Hydroplaning also exists.


AuRevoirAdios     Sat Feb 3 16:24:15 2018 UTC

Also, If it did work you&#39;d have to write it everywhere in small text like every square inch because other wise it could just get wet around these words and no one would be the wiser, that is until they slipped and broke their back. 
And I&#39;m pretty sure the point of wet floor signs is that nobody stares at the ground in stores. they stick out and are bright yellow.

nanoH2O     Sat Feb 3 16:17:44 2018 UTC

Except this answer is incorrect as well, at least from a mechanistic standpoint. 


THE_LURKER__     Sat Feb 3 16:54:44 2018 UTC

Are you saying the hydrophobic nature of a less absorbent surface doesn&#39;t correlate to a lowering of the coefficient of static friction or that something like tile does not have a hydrophobic surface?


nanoH2O     Sat Feb 3 17:41:57 2018 UTC

Well, using absorption here is irrelevant. It&#39;s based in surface energy. For water to absorb the surface throughout the porous structure would have to be hydrophilic, not hydrophobic. But, again, not relevant here. Second, the flooring is hydrophobic because the adhesive forces between the floor and water are less than the cohesive forces between water molecules. Whether it&#39;s slippery depends on your shoes. When we discuss terms like hydrophobicity, we are always talking about three phases, but we&#39;ll ignore the gas phase. We are talking about interfaces here, not absorption, though absorption is also controlled by these interfaces...not the cause, but maybe telling.
Last, if we did use say, a Teflon coating, which is certainly more hydrophobic than the flooring, then yes, the water would be driven away into the areas of lower surface energy. And if we coated a porous material like concrete, guess what, no water absorbs due to hydrophobicity, so it would work in that case too. That&#39;s what a sealant is doing to your patio.

patb2015     Sat Feb 3 16:42:10 2018 UTC

depends how polished the cement is.
If they finish with a broom finish, it absorbs rain fast and has &#39;grip&#39;.
if they finish to a polish then it can get quite slippery.

Wolf_Noble     Sat Feb 3 17:26:30 2018 UTC

Does that mean that people would be more likely to slip on the side walk if it had words like slippery written in hydrophobic paint on it?


democritus-prime     Sat Feb 3 21:57:16 2018 UTC

If it&#39;s a shinny hydrophobic surface, use a hydrophilic label that could change color. From clear to a color.  That would work well on a boat, fiberglass, and tile or wood.    For hydrophilic surfaces, use the hydrophobic labels or paint.


Mechasteel     Sat Feb 3 06:51:50 2018 UTC

Except it will very quickly say &quot;slippery&quot; all the time.


odidiman     Sat Feb 3 09:15:59 2018 UTC

Why?


Mechasteel     Sat Feb 3 10:29:59 2018 UTC

Dirt and oils would have a different affinity for a hydrophobic vs hydrophilic surface, so it would get dirty differently and when cleaned would get cleaned differently.

cezary806     Sat Feb 3 13:59:31 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic effect relies on the water tension and polarity, using a detergent destroys the tension and changes polarity so it basically makes water easier to penetrate and mix. Or instead of using a strong detergent and water you can use any type of petroleum based liquid - that&#39;s why oil and water don&#39;t mix unless you add detergent or wash it with petroleum.
tl;dr a fuckload of soap would do


arvliet     Sat Feb 3 14:21:21 2018 UTC

There is such a thing as optimal soap-age.  Detergents need to be mixed with water to work properly.  


Agouti     Sat Feb 3 15:06:07 2018 UTC

Detergents - specifically, surfactant based as is most common - would only be an issue for an oil based hydrophobic coating. You can achieve decent coatings using plastics which are resistant to mild solvents.
Hydrophobia is an important property of non-stick surfaces including frypans and high grade interior paints, neither of which is harmed by detergents.


snowboymn     Sat Feb 3 14:44:50 2018 UTC

Just use soap and gasoline!(benzene woulddo too)


PlutiPlus     Sat Feb 3 09:36:37 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic means it repels water. Doesn&#39;t really do much in the way of teleportation, time travel, or invisibility.


Natuday     Sat Feb 3 10:08:49 2018 UTC

are you sure about that? i thought when people mention &#39;hydro&#39; teleportation and invisibility are part of that package. 


nIBLIB     Sat Feb 3 13:02:09 2018 UTC

All those hydro dams are the reason we have no teleportation technology. The dam water and super powers. 


PlutiPlus     Sat Feb 3 15:28:06 2018 UTC

Only when you can&#39;t do real teleportation and have to settle for invisibility and sprinting to your destination, then smugly uttering &quot;voila!&quot; as you reappear; with jazz hands. Getting wet on your way there would raise some questions.


Archetypal_NPC     Sat Feb 3 14:52:15 2018 UTC

Ducman69     Sat Feb 3 15:11:01 2018 UTC

Then ensure that the hydrophobic paint is also slippery, and that way the warning is always accurate.

Matt_Shatt     Sat Feb 3 15:27:11 2018 UTC

I&#39;m honestly surprised public places haven&#39;t been scared into putting signs out all the time saying surfaced MAY be slippery. Like how now all bridges around here say they may be slippery. They used to go around and open the signs up when it was cold and wet. 


Kalkaline     Sat Feb 3 15:54:31 2018 UTC

It makes this a perfect shower thought because it&#39;s something that sounds great in the shower but the second you start telling other people about it, the idea gets destroyed with criticism.

Falling_Charizard     Sat Feb 3 14:09:06 2018 UTC

Well the water has to go somewhere, right? If you mop a floor that has been entirely coated with a hydrophobic coating the water is going to bead up and float around on top. Much like how ice is sticky until a layer of water is added or it begins to melt, that floor will be slippery as fuck.

It would bead on very flat surfaces, puddle where bumpy, and flow where sloped.

Off the top of my head, people that wouldn&#39;t frequent the place often wouldn&#39;t know of the original color and think it&#39;s normal and not wet. Unless I&#39;ve misunderstood


jorgomli     Sat Feb 3 14:50:49 2018 UTC

Huh? I don&#39;t think the hydrophobic properties of the paint change the color of the floor.

Oh snap I&#39;ve misunderstood it all it seems, I was thinking it was paint that changes colour when wet..


MannKR     Sat Feb 3 16:31:15 2018 UTC

Well, roads arent slippery when they are wet and by the time there is snow or ice the sign would be covered already. Plus cars go fast and you wouldnt be able to see it, plus its normally common knowledge that if its snowing or sleeting that the roads might be bad.

I know you&#39;re joking but most russians are actually very loyal and great friends. Just wanted to say that because in my experience they get too much stereotyping in european countries.


bobby_page     Sat Feb 3 21:51:23 2018 UTC

LittleBigKid2000     Sat Feb 3 11:57:18 2018 UTC

Or it would be revealed when the floor isn&#39;t slippery, then lawsuit.

You cant sue someone for not slipping lmao

I’d argue for you on the grounds of emotional distress. 


paging_doctor_who     Sat Feb 3 16:57:23 2018 UTC

Somebody would try. You&#39;d be surprised how dumb people are. At my work there was a guy that came in and said we would get sued if our outside lights weren&#39;t on all night, because someone would trip since it&#39;s dark out. Guy literally thought we could get sued for the sun going down. 


ElMenduko     Sat Feb 3 13:28:51 2018 UTC

Lawsuit? What?
Suing because you can&#39;t realise yourself that a floor is slippery and you should be careful on it?


WiseOctopus     Sat Feb 3 14:51:13 2018 UTC

Yeah, that&#39;s gonna happen.

That&#39;s... that&#39;s absolutely brilliant.


I_Bin_Painting     Sat Feb 3 11:31:13 2018 UTC

Floors that get slippy don&#39;t change colour much when they get wet, the hydrophobic paint works best on slightly porous things like cement or rough stone.


theaccidentist     Sat Feb 3 11:41:15 2018 UTC

And there goes a billion dollar idea


SeruEnam     Sat Feb 3 12:15:00 2018 UTC

Well... maybe we should write it in a cement mixture that has a similar color to the flooring and if it gets wet, the cement gets darker! 


I_want_that_pill     Sat Feb 3 13:30:18 2018 UTC

It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a cheaper way... What about brightly colored, clearly visible warning signs moulded from plastic and produced for less than a dollar?
Edit: I get that someone has to place the signs, but safety and reality dictate that pretty, water-activated signage isn&#39;t practical.


SeruEnam     Sat Feb 3 13:33:36 2018 UTC

You know, that would make sense, actually it&#39;s a really good idea. But you know, why go with your &#39;brilliant&#39; idea when our compulsive, thoughtless lies could fit this criteria better? 


SSPanzer101     Sat Feb 3 14:29:45 2018 UTC

Hmm, does anyone have enough money to lobby a few politicians into banning those yellow injection moulded plastic signs so that it becomes easier for us to push our compulsive thoughtless ideas?


UnnassignedMinion     Sat Feb 3 13:48:14 2018 UTC

Also consider that those signs have to be placed by people, and those people have to be paid.  The hydrophobic paint is a better idea.


Mentalink     Sat Feb 3 14:02:08 2018 UTC

Automation taking our jobs again!


maybsnot     Sat Feb 3 14:22:22 2018 UTC

Well if you&#39;re looking to cut labor, you can just fire the guy who washes the floor. 


NayrbEroom     Sat Feb 3 14:11:51 2018 UTC

Not really a factor its not like people are hiring someone just to put up that sign.


klasmedak     Sat Feb 3 14:12:15 2018 UTC

Or you could just leave the signs out all the time. 


HoodsInSuits     Sat Feb 3 14:06:58 2018 UTC

Also you have to take into account human error in sign placement etc. Really, its time for self warning signs. 


I_want_that_pill     Sat Feb 3 14:48:34 2018 UTC

Yeah, you&#39;re right. It would be ridiculous to think that a company has to hire a worker solely to place out a warning sign when a floor gets wet.


DagobahJim79     Sat Feb 3 15:06:18 2018 UTC

But then why is the floor wet? If you aren&#39;t paying a custodian, who made the floor wet and also who is going to mop up what&#39;s on the floor?


SpacemanCraig3     Sat Feb 3 17:36:53 2018 UTC

I pee on the floor at home depot.


RoastedRhino     Sat Feb 3 15:30:00 2018 UTC

I think they put those sign once when they open the door, and then leave them there forever.


hawkeyes732     Sat Feb 3 15:50:05 2018 UTC

That and if you did the paint idea, it would have to be painted everywhere. How big is the font going to be? The smaller you get the less area that gets covered and more paint you have use to make sure the entire floor area is covered. The larger the font, the less likely the whole word “slippery” is exposed. If it’s a small spill, and only part of a letter is exposed, does it really warn anyone walking on that area? It doesn’t take much liquid to make a surface very slippery. Not every spill is several ounces of water that will spread out. While I think it’s good step in the right direction, a plastic yellow sign is a smarter idea at the moment. 


Earllad     Sat Feb 3 13:10:19 2018 UTC

Someone on shark tank did a t shirt like that once. It would probably work!

SeruEnam     Sat Feb 3 15:11:44 2018 UTC

Are the solar highways slip resistant? I think we need to put &#39;yellow less than freaking a dollar signs&#39; all over the highway so people that are driving could know that floors are slippery when wet.... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


ShadowHandler     Sat Feb 3 13:02:21 2018 UTC

Also hydrophobic surfaces will probably be damaged foot traffic.


SSPanzer101     Sat Feb 3 14:35:21 2018 UTC

We&#39;ll just have to tell people to take their shoes off before entering, and pass out those thin pantyhose socks like they have at shoe stores for people trying on shoes.  
No problem! Hydrophobic paint idea is still a go.


_Aj_     Sat Feb 3 13:19:23 2018 UTC

No not really, we&#39;re still a go. If a surface is wet it reflects. If there is a distinct line between wet and perfectly dry it will be quite visible regardless of porocity of the surrounding surfaces. If there is no discernable difference then the floor shall not be wet enough to be a problem!
... I think


Whine-Merchant     Sat Feb 3 13:29:39 2018 UTC

Depends on lighting in the area, as well as whether or not the floor is polished.


DagobahJim79     Sat Feb 3 15:10:05 2018 UTC

You haven&#39;t been a custodian, I guess. What about when the floor is inside under poor lighting? What about when the line between wet and dark is not distinct (mopped until the mop went dry, so there is no clear line)?


_Aj_     Sat Feb 3 15:35:01 2018 UTC

Ah, I think the point of the coating is to be a &quot;first responder&quot; to wet areas, not a replacement to the physical signs.
It means should an area be wet which wasn&#39;t known yet, it would instantly indicate it is wet, warning people until it can be attended to


sunday_bestie     Sat Feb 3 13:53:22 2018 UTC

More like “an idea.”


_Atlamillia_     Sat Feb 3 12:50:44 2018 UTC

hesitantmaneatingcat     Sat Feb 3 13:29:45 2018 UTC

I realized that soon after posting, then I realized the op most likely knew that and was referring to the &quot;warning appearing by blood&quot; being the invention, not the contraption itself.

Oh. I didn&#39;t pick up on that either. I&#39;ve never seen anyone get injured in these and they seem safe, so I&#39;m not entirely sure what he&#39;s getting at. Those rock treadmills seem really cool though!

There is also hydrochromic paint. Changes color when wet


weldawadyathink     Sat Feb 3 13:22:56 2018 UTC

Doesn&#39;t it also last a few weeks or months at best on cement? It seems like it would be more work to repaint it all the time than to just put out yellow signs.


bfodder     Sat Feb 3 14:48:49 2018 UTC

Yes. On areas with heavy foot traffic it would probably last a couple days.


sonrad10     Sat Feb 3 13:11:33 2018 UTC

So it would work on pavements


Muppetude     Sat Feb 3 13:25:34 2018 UTC

Which typically don’t get too slippery when wet, so the warning would be pointless. 


sonrad10     Sat Feb 3 13:36:27 2018 UTC

This is true.
It could be put on patios, perhaps at somewhere like a garden centre. Those tend to be stone which gets darker when wet.


I_Bin_Painting     Sat Feb 3 14:14:59 2018 UTC

Yeah, but they don&#39;t get that slippy because of their porosity.
Hydrophobic coatings are (generally) much weaker than normal paint and are also naturally slippery whether wet or dry (think like teflon pan coating) so they aren&#39;t great underfoot in high traffic areas.


Rhameolution     Sat Feb 3 13:30:46 2018 UTC

xthatguy339x     Sat Feb 3 12:57:39 2018 UTC

Make the floor out of concrete, make it so that the floor dips in the center towards a drain very very slightly, and paint the whole floor in the paint. Now the floor will never be wet cus anything spilled will drain away. 


IAmTheAsteroid     Sat Feb 3 14:09:05 2018 UTC

It&#39;s a popular 90s UK rave track (called &quot;born slippy&quot;), used on the trainspotting soundtrack. Ive just replaced the link above with the more well-known version from the film.


duaneap     Sat Feb 3 14:22:51 2018 UTC

The whole portion of the ground would have to be equally wet too for it to be visible and intelligible which often isn&#39;t the case with spillages etc. What you&#39;ll end up having is &quot;T   O  . S    P    Y      N      ET.&quot;


driftsc     Sat Feb 3 16:44:11 2018 UTC

My driveway was sealed but the sidewalk wasn&#39;t. Maybe I should lay down a tape outline that says &quot;slippery&quot; and seal the sidewalk.


NewToMech     Sat Feb 3 12:07:11 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic surfaces are usually pretty slippery


AccidentalConception     Sat Feb 3 13:37:09 2018 UTC

Good thing it already says it&#39;s slippery then.


synopser     Sat Feb 3 14:59:03 2018 UTC

Just fucking print it on each tile in black ink, no?


Hawkmoona_Matata     Sat Feb 3 12:10:22 2018 UTC

Also probably way too expensive to be worth the time.
Not a hydrophobic paint expert though.


Anakin_Skywanker     Sat Feb 3 17:12:48 2018 UTC

I an not sure about paint but it costs less than $10 to make your car windshield hydrophobic. 


ReservoirDog316     Sat Feb 3 13:31:08 2018 UTC

Unless it&#39;s only partially wet. Then it&#39;ll say something like &quot;lip&quot; or &quot;pp&quot; or something. 


LOCO5150     Sat Feb 3 12:29:02 2018 UTC

PeesyewWoW     Sat Feb 3 13:10:05 2018 UTC

Actually no.. it&#39;s not. The pure price alone of all the paint would quickly make OP reevaluate his idea. Plus it makes no money.. where&#39;s the money coming from?!


RowdyWrongdoer     Sat Feb 3 13:16:39 2018 UTC

The money would come in reduction of legal fees from slip and falls. I dont think the cost of hydrophobic paint would outweigh it as it tends to break down under UV so would need reapplied. a 1 dollar &quot;slippery when wet&quot; sign is far more cost effective. 


mjmax     Sat Feb 3 15:12:30 2018 UTC

dropkickm     Sat Feb 3 14:55:47 2018 UTC

Someone already thought of that. There&#39;s a gif on Reddit somewhere of someone pouring water on the floor and it saying &quot;slippery.&quot;


Brotein_Pancake     Sat Feb 3 15:31:27 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic paints tend to wear off really easily, so it&#39;d work for maybe a week or two with moderate traffic. 


tonterias     Sat Feb 3 15:33:43 2018 UTC

We must write them in the showers floors too!


ChrisForScience     Sat Feb 3 10:34:51 2018 UTC

That could be counter-productive. Hydrophobic surfaces can be very slippery if water beads up on them. Think of a slip-and-slide toy. Water can serve as an oil-like lubricant on this type of surface. 


blastuponsometerries     Sat Feb 3 13:48:46 2018 UTC

Bizaboo420     Sat Feb 3 12:17:21 2018 UTC

Im surprised that no one els has pointed out the fact that you would need to coat every walkable surface in order for this to work. You could predict that entry ways are going to be wet if its raining and people are coming in but you cant pinpoint where someone is going to spill a drink or where something is going to leak onto the floor, it would have to be a pathway of &quot;slippery&quot; paint signs.


walsallscott     Sat Feb 3 12:25:17 2018 UTC

“Ok boss, I’ve got the idea of the century here. Know how floors get wet sometimes? Instead of using a 10 dollar plastic sign to notify people, what were Gona do is coat all of our floors in hydrophobic paint that will need to be reapplied every year or so.”

Freds_Jalopy     Sat Feb 3 14:27:32 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t mean to burst your bubble, but hydrophobic paint &quot;shows up&quot; when wet because the surface around it absorbs water, making that surrounding surface darker (think wet asphalt).
Surfaces that become slippery when wet do so because they don&#39;t absorb water (think tile), meaning they also don&#39;t get darker when wet.
The places this idea would be most useful are the exact places it wouldn&#39;t work. 


liontrap     Sat Feb 3 07:31:44 2018 UTC

Wait. Hydrophobic paint, paint that keeps things dry, to warn people that the thing is wet, when it isn&#39;t, because it&#39;s painted with hydrophobic paint.
Is this what you&#39;re suggesting?


I_Bin_Painting     Sat Feb 3 11:32:16 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic paint is quite delicate and also really slippy. 
So it would get ruined quickly by all the people falling over on it.


miguelz509     Sat Feb 3 08:23:10 2018 UTC

You only paint the word &quot;slippery&quot; on the floor with the paint, when it rains the floor will get wet and the hydrophobic paint will remain dry, showing the word &quot;slippery&quot;.


FondSteam39     Sat Feb 3 13:22:32 2018 UTC

What about the floor being wet makes normal paint un seeable? 


chaseoes     Sat Feb 3 13:54:16 2018 UTC

But then you would see it all the time.


liontrap     Sat Feb 3 08:23:52 2018 UTC

But why? Why not paint the whole floor so it stays dry?


theburgerman03     Sat Feb 3 09:53:24 2018 UTC

The floor would have to be perfectly smooth. The slightest, tiniest little dips and holes would cause water buildup. Think of really, really tiny bowls.


rubseb     Sat Feb 3 13:06:19 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic paint or coatings don&#39;t make water disappear. If you covered the bottom of a swimming pool in that stuff, it would fill up with water just the same. All it does is prevent the water from absorbing into the coated material.  On an inclined surface, that might keep it dry because the water rolls off it, but not on a level floor. 


CrotaSmash     Sat Feb 3 13:13:15 2018 UTC

It will still be slippy. But won&#39;t change colour. 


miguelz509     Sat Feb 3 08:31:31 2018 UTC

The paint might be expensive, so doing the whole floor would be really expensive,


Charles_Edison     Sat Feb 3 13:46:19 2018 UTC

I believe it is. I work at train stations though and this wouldn’t work for us. Our ticket hall floors get really slippery when it rains and are obviously indoors but they get slippery from people bringing water in in the bottom of their shoes so I don’t think the hydrophobic paint would get enough water around it to show up properly. 


thespacecase93     Sat Feb 3 06:25:39 2018 UTC

An elegant idea  


GRRRNADE     Sat Feb 3 14:19:56 2018 UTC

I do janitorial work and people are so oblivious they don’t even see neon yellow wet floor signs. 
Think they will notice it if it’s on the floor? I highly doubt it, lol.


Andrebatman     Sat Feb 3 11:50:44 2018 UTC

Yeah I read that comment on that repost also


dontwannabewrite     Sat Feb 3 13:59:25 2018 UTC

Except people don&#39;t look down when they&#39;re walking.


mss5333     Sat Feb 3 15:20:48 2018 UTC

I mean, they&#39;re looking down, but just at their phones  


Buck_Thorn     Sat Feb 3 14:18:49 2018 UTC

Aside from all the fun &amp; funny comments here... hydrophobic paint as it exists today, at least, wouldn&#39;t hold up to a single day&#39;s traffic.  I bought a kit to experiment with and found its uses to be pretty minimal because it isn&#39;t durable.


idontevencarewutever     Sat Feb 3 12:16:48 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic paint gets removed by mechanical agitation a lot. So literally everyone walking on it will destroy the paint.


Omnimatt     Sat Feb 3 13:43:10 2018 UTC

Hereabouts they have temperature sensitive signs that say &quot;warning, ice&quot; when it gets cold. Same kind of idea, but, yaknow, better


cpt_caveman     Sat Feb 3 15:56:30 2018 UTC

but then they wouldnt be slippery.
at my college, one of the coolest looking buildings was the main engineering building. It was also the deadliest.  Had tiles outside inbetween bits of concrete.. and man those tiles were like the slipperiest thing known to man, when it rained. they were podophobic. ice, doesnt even come close. you really might as well crawled to class on rainy days. I used to stop at the edge, and look over the mine field with dread.


bittenbarman     Sat Feb 3 16:44:33 2018 UTC

And make that hydrophobic paint gritty so people don’t slip ;)


jtdarwin     Sat Feb 3 14:46:56 2018 UTC

It would topple the wet floor sign industry in a matter of days and cost tens of jobs. This goes deeper than you think.


Trickyryan88     Sat Feb 3 14:57:27 2018 UTC

It would make jobs too though


MannKR     Sat Feb 3 16:40:39 2018 UTC

Pretty sure he was being sarcastic because this is an awful idea


We_Flatten_Stuff     Sat Feb 3 09:40:44 2018 UTC

Ironically where the hydrophobic paint is will be dry.


Dr_Herbert_Wangus     Sat Feb 3 12:36:54 2018 UTC

Or they could just paint the whole stair case and they&#39;d never be wet. 


daswatman     Sat Feb 3 12:45:46 2018 UTC

Or people could be careful walking with wet feet onto a tiled floor. Wet floor signs shouldn&#39;t need to be a thing unless there had been a spill or pee accident. 


MannKR     Sat Feb 3 16:42:55 2018 UTC

In case you forgot floors do need to be cleaned.


daswatman     Sat Feb 3 19:58:30 2018 UTC

Yeah but then the whole section should be blocked off. Like when your a child and not allowed on the tiles when they are wet. Ahh footprints


MannKR     Sat Feb 3 20:03:03 2018 UTC

So you think when they clean the toiletpaper aisle at walmart it should be blocked and nobody can buy toiletpaper? That doesnt happen lol 


daswatman     Sat Feb 3 20:18:39 2018 UTC

Can&#39;t they do it at night or something?


MannKR     Sat Feb 3 20:30:10 2018 UTC

Walmart is open 24/7 and why pay an extra worker to clean at night when using yellow caution signs cost little to nothing


skibo75     Sat Feb 3 13:11:00 2018 UTC

If you are going to paint the floor anyway, why not paint it with antislip or textured paint? 


falakr     Sat Feb 3 13:11:14 2018 UTC

The practical issue is a little different though.
Someone wouldn&#39;t read &quot;Slippery&quot; until getting to where it was slippery.That&#39;s why signs are upright.


frizbplaya     Sat Feb 3 13:26:59 2018 UTC

So the floors would say slippery, when wet?


zontarr2     Sat Feb 3 13:38:56 2018 UTC

&quot;This paint has rabies!&quot; 


trashtastictakeout     Sat Feb 3 13:40:32 2018 UTC

To build on this.... And address a much bigger issue.... We should use this in public bathrooms to notify people of wet toilet seats. 


iktnl     Sat Feb 3 13:54:10 2018 UTC

OP just slipped in the shower, right?


walyc     Sat Feb 3 14:51:59 2018 UTC

Why would anyone pay more money for paint than they had too? 


KatelynCowan     Sat Feb 3 14:52:46 2018 UTC

What about when some dick hole drops a roasted chicken on the ground in the market and doesn&#39;t clean it up very well.... we need paint for that


moodpecker     Sat Feb 3 15:40:57 2018 UTC

If they go that far, why not just paint the entire surface in hydrophobic paint so that it&#39;s not slippery?


godfetish     Sat Feb 3 15:48:11 2018 UTC

Or, they could apply a non-slick surface in the first place. My work used an acrylic enamel to seal the concrete, it&#39;s like walking on glass...add water and you got a slip and slide.


Zatchillac     Sat Feb 3 15:53:39 2018 UTC

Cover the whole store floor and then no more slippery? 


on3moresoul     Sat Feb 3 15:58:52 2018 UTC

And photo luminescent paint should be used on circuit breakers and where flashlights are stored. 


nooneisanonymous     Sat Feb 3 16:29:39 2018 UTC

Moist would be better. For some strange reason people on the Reddits are very strong reactions to this word.
Might work on Dangerous Electric Fences etc ...


Dominicmeoward     Sat Feb 3 16:41:18 2018 UTC

If you write moist then people who hate that word (not me, I don’t see the problem) then people will run away from it so far they’ll have left the store. Not good business IMO. Maybe the sign of the international stick figure slipping, like on a wet floor sign. The hydrophobic paint though is an awesome idea.


misatou     Sat Feb 3 17:26:04 2018 UTC

You mean <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Bon_jovi_slippery_when_wet.jpg" rel="nofollow">like this?</a>


broscientologist     Sat Feb 3 17:30:03 2018 UTC

At that point why not coat the whole floor so it isn’t slippery?


djs758     Sat Feb 3 17:34:02 2018 UTC

Won&#39;t work. Hydrophobic coatings are not durable. 


dudelookatree     Sat Feb 3 17:39:25 2018 UTC

Ah


Biz2324     Sat Feb 3 21:36:47 2018 UTC

Or, you know, people could just use fucking common sense and not require hand holding. A five year old knows wet surfaces are slippery.  


beerhead3216     Sat Feb 3 12:29:02 2018 UTC

I’m sorry if it’s a dumb question, but I don’t get it can someone explain. If you paint slippery on the ground wouldn’t it say slippery 24/7, doesn’t hydrophobic paint just repel water ? So the sign would not be slippery, but it’d just say slippery all the time anyway since it’s painted on the floor wouldn’t it ? Again I think I’m a bit slow so if someone could point out what I’m missing that would be great 


Gandalf1701D     Sat Feb 3 13:38:41 2018 UTC

A gif showed up a few days ago where people threw water at sidewalks and revealed street art that was hidden and only showed up when the sidewalks wet, I think this is what OP had in mind. 


Mr-Baseball     Sat Feb 3 13:39:41 2018 UTC

If they used a different colour paint to the floor for the sign, then it would always be there. But OP is thinking to plaint the word slippery out of hydrophobic paint that is the same color as the floor. When the rest of the floor gets wet and changes to a darker colour, that area stays the same color and reveals the word “slippery”


Biuku     Sat Feb 3 12:37:15 2018 UTC

With Bon Jovi as company spokes-band?


95zsora     Sat Feb 3 12:38:51 2018 UTC

why don&#39;t you just spray paint the whole thing


ColtAzayaka     Sat Feb 3 12:42:25 2018 UTC

Perhaps a floor that reacts with water to change colour while wet could be more accurate. 


RogerPackinrod     Sat Feb 3 12:49:45 2018 UTC

I&#39;d slip on that. 


MessengerOfCthulu     Sat Feb 3 12:54:05 2018 UTC

Or just paint the whole thing in hydrophobic paint so it doesn&#39;t get slippery in the first place...


nanoH2O     Sat Feb 3 16:22:13 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic surfaces are extremely slippery. Think Teflon non stick pans. Teflon is superhydrophobic, terminated with fluorinated functional groups. 


MessengerOfCthulu     Sat Feb 3 21:02:41 2018 UTC

Damn, there goes my genius plan.


VoteTheFox     Sat Feb 3 12:56:43 2018 UTC

s ipp  y 


uselessDM     Sat Feb 3 13:01:04 2018 UTC

This probably wouldn&#39;t work in reality since it wouldn&#39;t be obvious enough to be seen easily, especially at an angle. And it wouldn&#39;t last long enough if the surface is heavily used, which it probably would be.


Lump182     Sat Feb 3 13:08:01 2018 UTC

But then the area covered in hydrophobic paint would not in fact be slippery anymore. 
This would create a paradox that could destroy us all, you monster.


Aerodye     Sat Feb 3 13:12:22 2018 UTC

Lol why the fuck does this have so many upvotes that&#39;s such a stupid idea, just write it in normal paint - cheaper and far more legible?


rich6490     Sat Feb 3 13:13:34 2018 UTC

Then you couldn’t wax the floor, people walking on the paint would wear it off.
Those claiming “genius” clearly know nothing about floors or construction.

Hydrophobic coatings and paint don&#39;t tend to be very durable. So it would be rather expensive to maintain.


NullHaxSon     Sat Feb 3 13:42:18 2018 UTC

Some people pointed out issues with this idea but one I could think of is if a floor is waxed. If the floor was ever waxed again, then the hydrophobic paint would need to be reapplied over the wax. Also I&#39;m not sure the paint would give the look you&#39;re trying to achieve on these types of surfaces.


JackWithTheHammer     Sat Feb 3 13:42:32 2018 UTC

Can&#39;t they just completely cover them in hydrophobic paint, so they will stay dry and not be slippery to begin with?

Aren&#39;t hydrophobic surfaces with a tiny bit of water on them super slippery? Also I think they are quite delicate so they would get ground off by people walking there pretty quickly. 


SheLikesEveryone     Sat Feb 3 14:18:09 2018 UTC

They should use paint that&#39;s invisible when Dry but when it gets wet a watermark becomes visible that says slippery

DevilJHawk     Sat Feb 3 14:55:04 2018 UTC

Say we use a hydrophobic dye in the wax of a store floor. When wet it changes color. It wouldn&#39;t be very useful for the average visitor but it could be great at quickly identifying spills or slippery areas. 


_Zevan-3Stars_     Sat Feb 3 14:56:43 2018 UTC

Or... Make the entire surface hydrophobic so it never gets wet to begin with.


Optimus_Mediocre     Sat Feb 3 14:59:06 2018 UTC

antij0sh     Sat Feb 3 15:20:25 2018 UTC

A few thoughts , if your paying enough attention to see that the floor says something, you likely already know that it&#39;s wet, the signs that stick up are way more visible from a long distance than words flat on a shiny floor, by the time you could read it your already on the slippery bit.

jettamb     Sat Feb 3 15:59:43 2018 UTC

They should stop making shop floors, sidewalks, roads and stairs of the material, which can become slippery under any conditions.


Joey__stalin     Sat Feb 3 16:06:36 2018 UTC

They should write “slippy” instead and save some money on paint.

How am I supposed to fall and collect my insurance money


Manojative     Sat Feb 3 16:22:46 2018 UTC

Won&#39;t work if it&#39;s an oil spill


GonzoBalls69     Sat Feb 3 16:24:23 2018 UTC

This doesn&#39;t make any sense as a safety measure for obvious reasons, but it does make for clever street art. 


soofjamfever     Sat Feb 3 16:32:32 2018 UTC

Not to mention you&#39;d have to write &quot;slippery&quot; a bunch of times over the entire surface area of the floor, because it&#39;s not like you can predict where exactly the spill will be...


RobotJiz     Sat Feb 3 16:42:14 2018 UTC

That&#39;s why we have one of those irobot vacuums come out, but instead of cleaning up the spill, it tags a slippery stencil around the area in hydrophobic paint.


cactuspizza     Sat Feb 3 16:34:00 2018 UTC

What about people who can&#39;t read or don&#39;t know English? Use a symbol like on a wet floor sign. 


3kindsofsalt     Sat Feb 3 16:48:10 2018 UTC

If they could do that, why not just coat them so they aren&#39;t slippery?


digitalstorm     Sat Feb 3 16:52:47 2018 UTC

I&#39;m glad Elon Musk didn&#39;t post his SpaceX thoughts here for peer &quot;review&quot; back in the day...


hazpat     Sat Feb 3 16:56:02 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic surfaces are extra slippery though. You will increase the danger.


carlvaneijk     Sat Feb 3 16:59:13 2018 UTC

How can it get wet if it&#39;s covered n hydrophobic paint?


call-text-9318101210     Sat Feb 3 17:02:28 2018 UTC

It would say slippery when wet


findingbezu     Sat Feb 3 17:04:44 2018 UTC

A partially wet floor may only reveal the word slip.  An invitation?  Better put up a disclaimer sign next it but put it a stand of some kind so it doesn’t get wet... or slip.


wetbandit48     Sat Feb 3 17:12:30 2018 UTC

The yellow sign union will never let that happen 


alkeys05     Sat Feb 3 17:18:09 2018 UTC

If it&#39;s just a small puddle that only covers &quot;Slip-&quot;, does that mean the store is instructing me to sue them?


Goodfella1133     Sat Feb 3 17:45:47 2018 UTC

I’m waiting for a Migos meme.


FredrickTheFish     Sat Feb 3 18:09:50 2018 UTC

Imagine walking down the street as it starts to drizzle a bit and seeing the word &quot;slippery&quot; just ominously appear in front of you


InquisitiveShrug     Sat Feb 3 18:37:01 2018 UTC

They should write, &quot;Ground is dangerously hot&quot; on the asphalt in heat sensitive paint so pet owners know to protect their furry ones.


Nate_K789     Sat Feb 3 18:39:24 2018 UTC

Why not just cover them with the hydrophobic paint? Then there&#39;s no need to paint the warning because they won&#39;t be wet


expatjake     Sat Feb 3 18:53:40 2018 UTC

Why do you want to make people fall over?


BellHopBeepBopBoop     Sat Feb 3 20:50:16 2018 UTC

TIL there is such a thing as hydrophobic paint


SikinAyylmao     Sat Feb 3 20:54:38 2018 UTC

You 


qwefhsdf     Sat Feb 3 21:00:24 2018 UTC

Hydrophobic coatings are usually create microscopic surface features, like lotus leaves have. These would wear off though.


democritus-prime     Sat Feb 3 21:50:24 2018 UTC

That&#39;s awesome.  It&#39;s perfect for shinny surfaces and white boats when it&#39;s hard to tell and you don&#39;t want ugly signage all over the place.  You should niche that idea into the boat product market.  There&#39;s hundred of millions of dollars in that industry.  For boat safety commercial and consumer, world wide? Billions. 


laminatedwood     Sat Feb 3 23:23:40 2018 UTC

Excuse me. Please me.


Mac-shaun     Sat Feb 3 23:48:36 2018 UTC

If you&#39;re going to the trouble of putting something down. Why not just put something on there that makes it not slippery?


SJWCombatant     Sun Feb 4 00:38:02 2018 UTC

OP you do realize that hydrophobic paint is slippery when wet right?
