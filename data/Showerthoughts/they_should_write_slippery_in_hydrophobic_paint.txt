Roads and sidewalks don’t usually get slippery when wet - concrete and asphalt are extremely good at absorbing water. 
The reason while ceramic tile and hardwood get slippery when wet is <strong>because</strong> they are hydrophobic in the first place. The water doesn’t absorb into the floor (which would create a nice atmosphere for mold and swelling and a bunch of other fun things). 

does that mean the “concrete” all over my campus isn’t actual concrete? when it rains here, <em>everybody</em> slips at least three times before they make it to the next building 

Concrete can be sanded and polished. I think it’s a silly process, but I’ve been in a few garages with polished concrete. Slippery af 

That&#39;s common in Arizona.

It works much better there with little rain. Here in Michigan you don’t see it outdoors very often. 
Friend of mine use to have polished concrete around her hot tub. Imagine being drunk and walking on a glass floor smeared with astroglide. 
That’s the best way I can describe polished concrete when wet. 

Imagine being drunk and walking on a glass floor smeared with astroglide.
Go on...

It&#39;s even better on a blow up mattress, like an elevated super slick slip n slide. 

Am also from Michigan. My sister just bought a house with a lot of stamped concrete outside the front door and around back. That stuff wasn’t a great choice for this environment

Could try pressure washing the fuck out of it with the strongest pressure washer you can rent. I can tell you for a fact enough pressure will resurface them.

With how expensive that stuff is I know they don’t want to ruin it for resale value. They don’t play on staying there forever. Good idea for the future though if this problem ever comes up again in a more permanent situation

My mother suffered significant brain damage walking between the hot tub and the bathroom, wet foot on tile floor. She&#39;s now epileptic, cross, and struggles to tell anecdotes. This isn&#39;t worth it -- please consider asking your friend to make a safer compromise.

Someone at my school in Seattle decided that it would be a good idea to polish sections of the concrete outside. Good thing it never rains in Seattle so I never almost break my ass every time I walk between buildings. 

oh yeah we’re about a half hour away from the arizona border so it is <em>that</em> kind of weather. it doesn’t rain much but i walk to and from campus so it sucks when it does
edit: <em>border</em>

Concrete can also be finished super slick and less absorbent if you ask for it. The roughness and absorbance of concrete are entirely up to the guy finishing it, if he knows what he&#39;s doing.

Slippery but fun as fuck. Moonwalking. Concrete skating. Ballet. You name it. If you can slide. You can do it. 
Call now!

That&#39;s only after they achieve the right finish on the concrete.  Its called a hard trowel fibish.  After the concrete is cured it can be polished

Growing up my neighbor had a pool and I remember always running home after swimming and slipping in our garage. I’ve smacked the back of my head many times in that garage. However, it was kinda nice when it was dry. I don’t know why, but when working on my car I preferred the slick garage floor to the rough driveway. Maybe cause it was easier to slide around under my car, idk

The shop I work In has this it’s a bitch to clean/walk on if oil gets on it

Lol. It is a smooth trowel finish. Sidewalks and roads are finished with a broom to give it texture so people do slip.

Nah its concrete.

Is it painted? 

Absorption has nothing to do with hydrophobicity. It&#39;s based on relative surface energy. A superhydrophobic floor would be very slippery, yes, but because the adhesive force of water to  the floor is very low, thus it acts as a lubricant. Not because water doesn&#39;t absorb into the structure of the floor.
In fact, OP&#39;s suggestion would work just fine as long as paint is more hydrophobic than flooring. Water will move into lower surface energy area. 

It&#39;s not a matter of the water moving.  It&#39;s  about color change when wet.

Lol, why do you think it changes color?? A material cannot absorb water if it&#39;s hydrophobic. Stop upvoting this person and spreading this utter nonsense 

This is really the best question. Why do i think <em>what</em> changes color? 

Yeah ok, I agree it definitely doesn&#39;t change color, maybe shades is a better description 

This is the best answer. Concrete and asphalt absorb water pretty well. That&#39;s why they get darker when wet. These surfaces are also slip resistant (concrete with a raked surface, anyway). There&#39;s no need to put warnings on slip resistant surfaces. Slippery surfaces are usually painted with some water resistant coating or are a lowet porous material like polished stone or ceramic tile. The &quot;warning&quot; would be invisible when wet because the slippery surfaces tend not to change color. 

This is the best answer

Why do surfaces that absorb water get darker when wet?

Much like human skin can absorb sunlight, giving us a sun tan, surfaces that absorb water tend to get a water tan. Just like suntans fade when all the sun has escaped your skin, the sidewalk turns back to its usual color once the water evaporates. Human skin is waterproof, otherwise we&#39;d get water tans too! Although we&#39;d probably also leak blood and other fluids everywhere, so it&#39;s probably a good thing we don&#39;t. 

<a href="/r/kenm" rel="nofollow">r/kenm</a>

<a href="/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin" rel="nofollow">/r/ExplainLikeImCalvin</a> 

kinda thought we got darker cause the cells were damaged, rather than we&#39;re absorbing sunlight. i mean, we do, in a sense, but the change isn&#39;t from the sunlight absorbed, its uv damage.

This is the best question. Color change (really the essence of this showerthought) was mentioned by my answer, repeating the best answer, but was not addressed in the best answer. 

That and tile usually gets stripped and a new clear coat put on it. We used to do it once a week at a grocery that I worked at when I was a kid.

Extremely, is probably the wrong word to use, asa concrete surface doesn&#39;t absorb water as well as a sponge

I hope people don&#39;t start to ignore the highway code and drive with the same amount of gap whether the road is wet or dry because of this; there&#39;s still surface water on the road and there&#39;s a reason you should double your gap to 4 seconds. Hydroplaning also exists.

Also, If it did work you&#39;d have to write it everywhere in small text like every square inch because other wise it could just get wet around these words and no one would be the wiser, that is until they slipped and broke their back. 
And I&#39;m pretty sure the point of wet floor signs is that nobody stares at the ground in stores. they stick out and are bright yellow.

The 20,000+ people that upvoted this tells me this sub isn&#39;t full of critical thinkers

It belongs more on <a href="/r/shittyaskscience" rel="nofollow">/r/shittyaskscience</a>. 

I dunno man, it&#39;s a clever idea anyway. Plus it prompted some genuinely interesting scientific discussion. I&#39;m sure most people upvoted because if the title, but I did because of the discussion. 

I&#39;m glad this was the top answer, when I saw the upvotes the post had gotten I thought maybe this idea was gaining traction.

Except this answer is incorrect as well, at least from a mechanistic standpoint. 

Are you saying the hydrophobic nature of a less absorbent surface doesn&#39;t correlate to a lowering of the coefficient of static friction or that something like tile does not have a hydrophobic surface?

Well, using absorption here is irrelevant. It&#39;s based in surface energy. For water to absorb the surface throughout the porous structure would have to be hydrophilic, not hydrophobic. But, again, not relevant here. Second, the flooring is hydrophobic because the adhesive forces between the floor and water are less than the cohesive forces between water molecules. Whether it&#39;s slippery depends on your shoes. When we discuss terms like hydrophobicity, we are always talking about three phases, but we&#39;ll ignore the gas phase. We are talking about interfaces here, not absorption, though absorption is also controlled by these interfaces...not the cause, but maybe telling.
Last, if we did use say, a Teflon coating, which is certainly more hydrophobic than the flooring, then yes, the water would be driven away into the areas of lower surface energy. And if we coated a porous material like concrete, guess what, no water absorbs due to hydrophobicity, so it would work in that case too. That&#39;s what a sealant is doing to your patio. 

Its the day after raining where roads are slippery. 

depends how polished the cement is.
If they finish with a broom finish, it absorbs rain fast and has &#39;grip&#39;.
if they finish to a polish then it can get quite slippery.

Take that nerd! 

Ok lets use hydrophilic paint then

My town had slate sidewalks growing up... that shit was so incredibly slippery you&#39;d be lucky to survive walking to your car

This must be the most up voted nonsense I&#39;ve read on here &quot;concrete and asphalt absorb water a hardwood does not&quot;... Hilarious

Does that mean that people would be more likely to slip on the side walk if it had words like slippery written in hydrophobic paint on it?

If it&#39;s a shinny hydrophobic surface, use a hydrophilic label that could change color. From clear to a color.  That would work well on a boat, fiberglass, and tile or wood.    For hydrophilic surfaces, use the hydrophobic labels or paint.

Except it will very quickly say &quot;slippery&quot; all the time.

Why?

Dirt and oils would have a different affinity for a hydrophobic vs hydrophilic surface, so it would get dirty differently and when cleaned would get cleaned differently.

It should say &#39;dirty&#39; then

<em>&quot;this floor is a mind-reader!&quot;</em>

Hey, I think the rear window of my car has this feature!

Maybe some R&amp;D and little marketing could figure out a way to make some money on that idea though. 

Dirt/debris buildup I assume?

Just wash it with soap and wat... Oh I see the problem.

Hydrophobic effect relies on the water tension and polarity, using a detergent destroys the tension and changes polarity so it basically makes water easier to penetrate and mix. Or instead of using a strong detergent and water you can use any type of petroleum based liquid - that&#39;s why oil and water don&#39;t mix unless you add detergent or wash it with petroleum.
tl;dr a fuckload of soap would do

There is such a thing as optimal soap-age.  Detergents need to be mixed with water to work properly.  

Detergents - specifically, surfactant based as is most common - would only be an issue for an oil based hydrophobic coating. You can achieve decent coatings using plastics which are resistant to mild solvents.
Hydrophobia is an important property of non-stick surfaces including frypans and high grade interior paints, neither of which is harmed by detergents.

Just use soap and gasoline!(benzene woulddo too)

Hydrophobic means it repels water. Doesn&#39;t really do much in the way of teleportation, time travel, or invisibility.

are you sure about that? i thought when people mention &#39;hydro&#39; teleportation and invisibility are part of that package. 

All those hydro dams are the reason we have no teleportation technology. The dam water and super powers. 

Only when you can&#39;t do real teleportation and have to settle for invisibility and sprinting to your destination, then smugly uttering &quot;voila!&quot; as you reappear; with jazz hands. Getting wet on your way there would raise some questions.

What about invulnerability?

Then ensure that the hydrophobic paint is also slippery, and that way the warning is always accurate. 

I like your way of solving problems!

I&#39;m honestly surprised public places haven&#39;t been scared into putting signs out all the time saying surfaced MAY be slippery. Like how now all bridges around here say they may be slippery. They used to go around and open the signs up when it was cold and wet. 

It makes this a perfect shower thought because it&#39;s something that sounds great in the shower but the second you start telling other people about it, the idea gets destroyed with criticism.

Plus you would have to write it everywhere 

Why not cover the whole road, path, floor in it? 🤔

The paint itself would still get wet and be as slippery as the rest of the floor

Or does the water get painted instead? Nobody knows. Particle Man.

I get your reference. Going to listen to TMBG  now!

Not if it&#39;s slopped at a slight angle.

bah, flat surfaces, who needs it. 

we need it because the earth is flat

Can&#39;t we tilt the world one way to have all the water run?

The US government would never allow it

Lol no it wouldn&#39;t, that&#39;s the point of hydrophobic coating.

He meant the water would just sit on top of the floor. This doing absolute nothing. Unless it’s sloped like the other guy said. 

Those thermoplastic lane markers they use instead of paint are slick as shit.  I&#39;d assume this is the same.  Your shoes/tires are already wet.  &quot;steps on hydrophobic surface.    SWOOOOSH!&quot;

I ate shit holding my daughter outside of a Chic Fil a right after one of those summer downpours that lasts 15 minutes.   
It was probably the 3rd or 4th time new paint/road markers have made me wipe out. 
Crap is annoying and extremely unsafe for where people walk. 

It&#39;s unsafe as fuck for motorcycles too. I remember almost wiping out a couple times passing over a wet paint line while leaned into a turn. Had a friend go down right in front of me the instant his front tire hit the paint line, and he was only going about 10mph. They&#39;re as slick as ice.

Jesus Christ man you just brought me back to riding highway for the first time in Florida in the rain on a 250. Rear end wobbles on me switching lanes over one of those lines. 
I almost shit myself. My sphincter could have produced a diamond in that moment. 

Well the water has to go somewhere, right? If you mop a floor that has been entirely coated with a hydrophobic coating the water is going to bead up and float around on top. Much like how ice is sticky until a layer of water is added or it begins to melt, that floor will be slippery as fuck. 

Just wisk the water off with one of those rubber windshield wiper things.

Where does the water go if the whole floor is hydrophobic?

To hell

Need to put some on my bosses floor.

But that&#39;s where all the water goes already

It gets dammed to hell. 

Presumably you wouldn&#39;t make the floor concave, and would have outlets or a slope for the water.

Yes

So where would the water go if the whole floor was covered? 

It would bead on very flat surfaces, puddle where bumpy, and flow where sloped.

Of course. Maybe we should invent a floor that just doesn’t get slippery?

Sandpaper floor! 

Off the top of my head, people that wouldn&#39;t frequent the place often wouldn&#39;t know of the original color and think it&#39;s normal and not wet. Unless I&#39;ve misunderstood

Huh? I don&#39;t think the hydrophobic properties of the paint change the color of the floor. 

Oh snap I&#39;ve misunderstood it all it seems, I was thinking it was paint that changes colour when wet..

Well, roads arent slippery when they are wet and by the time there is snow or ice the sign would be covered already. Plus cars go fast and you wouldnt be able to see it, plus its normally common knowledge that if its snowing or sleeting that the roads might be bad.

It would either be to small to read or never fully revealed. Then lawsuit.

Maybe this would be a better idea for outside america

Europeans love lawsuits almost as much as Americans. Russians all have dash cameras to avoid lawsuits

Russians all have dashcams because it&#39;s unlikely to have a witness when you have an accident 200km away from the nearest form of civilization... 

No witnesses... in Soviet Russia, dashcam forks you.

Russia is rapey looking uncle in the european family that everyone hopes doesn&#39;t show up at gatherings.

It&#39;s that uncle that helped you once and then locked you in a basement with a hammer and sickle for 50 years.

that beat us to pulp twice and then locked us in a basement 
FTFY (I&#39;m from eastern Germany)

Ostalgie is still going strong, I see.

god no I&#39;m glad I&#39;m in Munich now.

I know you&#39;re joking but most russians are actually very loyal and great friends. Just wanted to say that because in my experience they get too much stereotyping in european countries.

I don&#39;t know any russians but russia as a state is scary AF

Yeah the government is very corrupt, but the people are very nice.

We&#39;ll i was thinking something like checkerboard but you could do something with symbols too

Or it would be revealed when the floor isn&#39;t slippery, then lawsuit.

You cant sue someone for not slipping lmao

Not with that attitude you can&#39;t.

<em>I was expecting the floor to be slippery, so I walked slowly! But it wasn&#39;t slippery!</em>
<em>I want to sue for emotional damage and lost time!</em>

I’d argue for you on the grounds of emotional distress. 

Somebody would try. You&#39;d be surprised how dumb people are. At my work there was a guy that came in and said we would get sued if our outside lights weren&#39;t on all night, because someone would trip since it&#39;s dark out. Guy literally thought we could get sued for the sun going down. 

Lawsuit? What?
Suing because you can&#39;t realise yourself that a floor is slippery and you should be careful on it?

Yeah, that&#39;s gonna happen.

In my country, absolutely. 

I&#39;m pretty sure they already paint words in the middle of roads and that doesn&#39;t happen

Merica weird yo

That&#39;s... that&#39;s absolutely brilliant.

Floors that get slippy don&#39;t change colour much when they get wet, the hydrophobic paint works best on slightly porous things like cement or rough stone.

And there goes a billion dollar idea

Well... maybe we should write it in a cement mixture that has a similar color to the flooring and if it gets wet, the cement gets darker! 

It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a cheaper way... What about brightly colored, clearly visible warning signs moulded from plastic and produced for less than a dollar?
Edit: I get that someone has to place the signs, but safety and reality dictate that pretty, water-activated signage isn&#39;t practical.

You know, that would make sense, actually it&#39;s a really good idea. But you know, why go with your &#39;brilliant&#39; idea when our compulsive, thoughtless lies could fit this criteria better? 

Hmm, does anyone have enough money to lobby a few politicians into banning those yellow injection moulded plastic signs so that it becomes easier for us to push our compulsive thoughtless ideas?

Also consider that those signs have to be placed by people, and those people have to be paid.  The hydrophobic paint is a better idea.

Automation taking our jobs again!

Well if you&#39;re looking to cut labor, you can just fire the guy who washes the floor. 

Not really a factor its not like people are hiring someone just to put up that sign.

Or you could just leave the signs out all the time. 

Also you have to take into account human error in sign placement etc. Really, its time for self warning signs. 

Yeah, you&#39;re right. It would be ridiculous to think that a company has to hire a worker solely to place out a warning sign when a floor gets wet.

But then why is the floor wet? If you aren&#39;t paying a custodian, who made the floor wet and also who is going to mop up what&#39;s on the floor?

I pee on the floor at home depot.

I think they put those sign once when they open the door, and then leave them there forever.

That and if you did the paint idea, it would have to be painted everywhere. How big is the font going to be? The smaller you get the less area that gets covered and more paint you have use to make sure the entire floor area is covered. The larger the font, the less likely the whole word “slippery” is exposed. If it’s a small spill, and only part of a letter is exposed, does it really warn anyone walking on that area? It doesn’t take much liquid to make a surface very slippery. Not every spill is several ounces of water that will spread out. While I think it’s good step in the right direction, a plastic yellow sign is a smarter idea at the moment.

Maybe we could just replace all of the highways with SOLAR FREAKING HIGHWAYS. 

Are the solar highways slip resistant? I think we need to put &#39;yellow less than freaking a dollar signs&#39; all over the highway so people that are driving could know that floors are slippery when wet.... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Hey. I heard someone wants to buy some hydrophobic paint that works on smooth surfaces? That&#39;ll be $999,999,999 dollars please.

Pfft. I could do it for $999,999,998.50, tops. 

I’ll do it for 25 SCHMEK-ELLLS! 

That&#39;s how much I spent on mah big fake boobies!

Also hydrophobic surfaces will probably be damaged foot traffic.

We&#39;ll just have to tell people to take their shoes off before entering, and pass out those thin pantyhose socks like they have at shoe stores for people trying on shoes.  
No problem! Hydrophobic paint idea is still a go.

No not really, we&#39;re still a go. If a surface is wet it reflects. If there is a distinct line between wet and perfectly dry it will be quite visible regardless of porocity of the surrounding surfaces. If there is no discernable difference then the floor shall not be wet enough to be a problem!
... I think

Depends on lighting in the area, as well as whether or not the floor is polished.

You haven&#39;t been a custodian, I guess. What about when the floor is inside under poor lighting? What about when the line between wet and dark is not distinct (mopped until the mop went dry, so there is no clear line)?

Ah, I think the point of the coating is to be a &quot;first responder&quot; to wet areas, not a replacement to the physical signs.
It means should an area be wet which wasn&#39;t known yet, it would instantly indicate it is wet, warning people until it can be attended to

More like “an idea.”

It&#39;s almost as if some jackass on reddit coming up with an idea in seconds is never, ever, ever, ever, ever going to result in a concept professionals and engineers haven&#39;t considered and thrown out already 

Well to be fair it wouldnt be the first time i saw something and thought “did really no one come up with this earlier?”

I mean we sent someone to the moon before we thought to put wheels on luggage

Wow. TIL

Yes but the luggage was faked

To be fair,  ideas have to start somewhere. Why not reddit? 

Why not Zoidberg?

C’mooooooooon, I’m Dr. Zoidberg

We have an idea on the identity of the Boston Bomber!

Yeah, but the point is that someone did come up with it earlier, then realised it wouldn&#39;t work.

I realized that soon after posting, then I realized the op most likely knew that and was referring to the &quot;warning appearing by blood&quot; being the invention, not the contraption itself.

Oh. I didn&#39;t pick up on that either. I&#39;ve never seen anyone get injured in these and they seem safe, so I&#39;m not entirely sure what he&#39;s getting at. Those rock treadmills seem really cool though!

In every single one of these brilliant reddit ideas, there&#39;s always that one thing that keeps it away from working 

There is also hydrochromic paint. Changes color when wet

Doesn&#39;t it also last a few weeks or months at best on cement? It seems like it would be more work to repaint it all the time than to just put out yellow signs.

Yes. On areas with heavy foot traffic it would probably last a couple days.

So it would work on pavements

Which typically don’t get too slippery when wet, so the warning would be pointless. 

This is true.
It could be put on patios, perhaps at somewhere like a garden centre. Those tend to be stone which gets darker when wet.

Yeah, but they don&#39;t get that slippy because of their porosity.
Hydrophobic coatings are (generally) much weaker than normal paint and are also naturally slippery whether wet or dry (think like teflon pan coating) so they aren&#39;t great underfoot in high traffic areas.

Username checks out. This guy paints.

Username checks out

Make the floor out of concrete, make it so that the floor dips in the center towards a drain very very slightly, and paint the whole floor in the paint. Now the floor will never be wet cus anything spilled will drain away.

It&#39;s a popular 90s UK rave track (called &quot;born slippy&quot;), used on the trainspotting soundtrack. Ive just replaced the link above with the more well-known version from the film.

The whole portion of the ground would have to be equally wet too for it to be visible and intelligible which often isn&#39;t the case with spillages etc. What you&#39;ll end up having is &quot;T   O  . S    P    Y      N      ET.&quot;

My driveway was sealed but the sidewalk wasn&#39;t. Maybe I should lay down a tape outline that says &quot;slippery&quot; and seal the sidewalk.

Hydrophobic surfaces are usually pretty slippery

Good thing it already says it&#39;s slippery then.

Just fucking print it on each tile in black ink, no?

Also probably way too expensive to be worth the time.
Not a hydrophobic paint expert though.

I an not sure about paint but it costs less than $10 to make your car windshield hydrophobic. 

Unless it&#39;s only partially wet. Then it&#39;ll say something like &quot;lip&quot; or &quot;pp&quot; or something. 

Until I slip on the hydrophobic paint and sue for millions...muah ha ha ha

Actually no.. it&#39;s not. The pure price alone of all the paint would quickly make OP reevaluate his idea. Plus it makes no money.. where&#39;s the money coming from?!

The money would come in reduction of legal fees from slip and falls. I dont think the cost of hydrophobic paint would outweigh it as it tends to break down under UV so would need reapplied. a 1 dollar &quot;slippery when wet&quot; sign is far more cost effective. 

Jesus not everything needs to make money

Money makes the world go round.

Here&#39;s you, walking around, in a rainy day:<br/>You walk out your SLIPPERY sidewalk<br/>Keep walking along the SLIPPERY  SLIPPERY  SLIPPERY  SLIPPERY road<br/>Enter a  SLIPPERY  store by its SLIPPERY  stairs.<br/>And going back home it&#39;s SLIPPERY  SLIPPERY. SLIPPERY all over again  

Someone already thought of that. There&#39;s a gif on Reddit somewhere of someone pouring water on the floor and it saying &quot;slippery.&quot;

Hydrophobic paints tend to wear off really easily, so it&#39;d work for maybe a week or two with moderate traffic. 

We must write them in the showers floors too!

That could be counter-productive. Hydrophobic surfaces can be very slippery if water beads up on them. Think of a slip-and-slide toy. Water can serve as an oil-like lubricant on this type of surface. 

You say counter productive, I say it becomes even more honest 

It’s both more honest AND counter-productive, like my retired grandpa.

Did you get this idea from the hydrophobic paint on <a href="/r/oddlysatisfying">r/oddlysatisfying</a>?

For the lazy... <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif">https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif</a>

Thank you! 

Fucking Siths, only dealing in absolutes.  
What about when it&#39;s not wet enough yet and it all looks like weird shit in your pathway?  What was a normal stride back to your car from Wal-Mart before getting distracted turned into a bad Life-Alert commercial.

Lippery

Li  e

They should do this in urinals 

&quot;You missed.&quot;

Why would they write slippery on urinals? 

Because urinals are slippery when wet, duh

Im surprised that no one els has pointed out the fact that you would need to coat every walkable surface in order for this to work. You could predict that entry ways are going to be wet if its raining and people are coming in but you cant pinpoint where someone is going to spill a drink or where something is going to leak onto the floor, it would have to be a pathway of &quot;slippery&quot; paint signs.

or you know, just put a normal sign there

“Ok boss, I’ve got the idea of the century here. Know how floors get wet sometimes? Instead of using a 10 dollar plastic sign to notify people, what were Gona do is coat all of our floors in hydrophobic paint that will need to be reapplied every year or so.” 
“You’re fired”

<a href="https://i.redd.it/iwin8wqlxotz.jpg" rel="nofollow">So... like this?</a>

I don&#39;t mean to burst your bubble, but hydrophobic paint &quot;shows up&quot; when wet because the surface around it absorbs water, making that surrounding surface darker (think wet asphalt).
Surfaces that become slippery when wet do so because they don&#39;t absorb water (think tile), meaning they also don&#39;t get darker when wet.
The places this idea would be most useful are the exact places it wouldn&#39;t work. 

Wait. Hydrophobic paint, paint that keeps things dry, to warn people that the thing is wet, when it isn&#39;t, because it&#39;s painted with hydrophobic paint.
Is this what you&#39;re suggesting?

Hydrophobic paint is quite delicate and also really slippy. 
So it would get ruined quickly by all the people falling over on it.

You only paint the word &quot;slippery&quot; on the floor with the paint, when it rains the floor will get wet and the hydrophobic paint will remain dry, showing the word &quot;slippery&quot;.

What about the floor being wet makes normal paint un seeable? 

But then you would see it all the time.

But why? Why not paint the whole floor so it stays dry?

The floor would have to be perfectly smooth. The slightest, tiniest little dips and holes would cause water buildup. Think of really, really tiny bowls.

Hydrophobic paint or coatings don&#39;t make water disappear. If you covered the bottom of a swimming pool in that stuff, it would fill up with water just the same. All it does is prevent the water from absorbing into the coated material.  On an inclined surface, that might keep it dry because the water rolls off it, but not on a level floor. 

It will still be slippy. But won&#39;t change colour. 

The paint might be expensive, so doing the whole floor would be really expensive,

I believe it is. I work at train stations though and this wouldn’t work for us. Our ticket hall floors get really slippery when it rains and are obviously indoors but they get slippery from people bringing water in in the bottom of their shoes so I don’t think the hydrophobic paint would get enough water around it to show up properly. 

An elegant idea  

I do janitorial work and people are so oblivious they don’t even see neon yellow wet floor signs. 
Think they will notice it if it’s on the floor? I highly doubt it, lol.

Yeah I read that comment on that repost also

Except people don&#39;t look down when they&#39;re walking.

I mean, they&#39;re looking down, but just at their phones  

Aside from all the fun &amp; funny comments here... hydrophobic paint as it exists today, at least, wouldn&#39;t hold up to a single day&#39;s traffic.  I bought a kit to experiment with and found its uses to be pretty minimal because it isn&#39;t durable.

Hydrophobic paint gets removed by mechanical agitation a lot. So literally everyone walking on it will destroy the paint.

Hereabouts they have temperature sensitive signs that say &quot;warning, ice&quot; when it gets cold. Same kind of idea, but, yaknow, better

but then they wouldnt be slippery.
at my college, one of the coolest looking buildings was the main engineering building. It was also the deadliest.  Had tiles outside inbetween bits of concrete.. and man those tiles were like the slipperiest thing known to man, when it rained. they were podophobic. ice, doesnt even come close. you really might as well crawled to class on rainy days. I used to stop at the edge, and look over the mine field with dread.

And make that hydrophobic paint gritty so people don’t slip ;)

It would topple the wet floor sign industry in a matter of days and cost tens of jobs. This goes deeper than you think.

It would make jobs too though

Pretty sure he was being sarcastic because this is an awful idea

Ironically where the hydrophobic paint is will be dry.

Or they could just paint the whole stair case and they&#39;d never be wet. 

Or people could be careful walking with wet feet onto a tiled floor. Wet floor signs shouldn&#39;t need to be a thing unless there had been a spill or pee accident. 

In case you forgot floors do need to be cleaned.

Yeah but then the whole section should be blocked off. Like when your a child and not allowed on the tiles when they are wet. Ahh footprints

So you think when they clean the toiletpaper aisle at walmart it should be blocked and nobody can buy toiletpaper? That doesnt happen lol 

Can&#39;t they do it at night or something?

Walmart is open 24/7 and why pay an extra worker to clean at night when using yellow caution signs cost little to nothing

If you are going to paint the floor anyway, why not paint it with antislip or textured paint? 

The practical issue is a little different though.
Someone wouldn&#39;t read &quot;Slippery&quot; until getting to where it was slippery.That&#39;s why signs are upright.

So the floors would say slippery, when wet?

&quot;This paint has rabies!&quot; 

To build on this.... And address a much bigger issue.... We should use this in public bathrooms to notify people of wet toilet seats. 

OP just slipped in the shower, right?

Why would anyone pay more money for paint than they had too? 

What about when some dick hole drops a roasted chicken on the ground in the market and doesn&#39;t clean it up very well.... we need paint for that

If they go that far, why not just paint the entire surface in hydrophobic paint so that it&#39;s not slippery?

Or, they could apply a non-slick surface in the first place. My work used an acrylic enamel to seal the concrete, it&#39;s like walking on glass...add water and you got a slip and slide.

Cover the whole store floor and then no more slippery? 

And photo luminescent paint should be used on circuit breakers and where flashlights are stored. 

Moist would be better. For some strange reason people on the Reddits are very strong reactions to this word.
Might work on Dangerous Electric Fences etc ...

If you write moist then people who hate that word (not me, I don’t see the problem) then people will run away from it so far they’ll have left the store. Not good business IMO. Maybe the sign of the international stick figure slipping, like on a wet floor sign. The hydrophobic paint though is an awesome idea.

You mean <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Bon_jovi_slippery_when_wet.jpg" rel="nofollow">like this?</a>

At that point why not coat the whole floor so it isn’t slippery?

Won&#39;t work. Hydrophobic coatings are not durable. 

Ah

Or, you know, people could just use fucking common sense and not require hand holding. A five year old knows wet surfaces are slippery.  

I’m sorry if it’s a dumb question, but I don’t get it can someone explain. If you paint slippery on the ground wouldn’t it say slippery 24/7, doesn’t hydrophobic paint just repel water ? So the sign would not be slippery, but it’d just say slippery all the time anyway since it’s painted on the floor wouldn’t it ? Again I think I’m a bit slow so if someone could point out what I’m missing that would be great 

A gif showed up a few days ago where people threw water at sidewalks and revealed street art that was hidden and only showed up when the sidewalks wet, I think this is what OP had in mind. 

If they used a different colour paint to the floor for the sign, then it would always be there. But OP is thinking to plaint the word slippery out of hydrophobic paint that is the same color as the floor. When the rest of the floor gets wet and changes to a darker colour, that area stays the same color and reveals the word “slippery”

With Bon Jovi as company spokes-band?

why don&#39;t you just spray paint the whole thing

Perhaps a floor that reacts with water to change colour while wet could be more accurate. 

I&#39;d slip on that. 

Or just paint the whole thing in hydrophobic paint so it doesn&#39;t get slippery in the first place...

Hydrophobic surfaces are extremely slippery. Think Teflon non stick pans. Teflon is superhydrophobic, terminated with fluorinated functional groups. 

Damn, there goes my genius plan.

s ipp  y 

This probably wouldn&#39;t work in reality since it wouldn&#39;t be obvious enough to be seen easily, especially at an angle. And it wouldn&#39;t last long enough if the surface is heavily used, which it probably would be.

But then the area covered in hydrophobic paint would not in fact be slippery anymore. 
This would create a paradox that could destroy us all, you monster.

Lol why the fuck does this have so many upvotes that&#39;s such a stupid idea, just write it in normal paint - cheaper and far more legible?

Then you couldn’t wax the floor, people walking on the paint would wear it off.
Those claiming “genius” clearly know nothing about floors or construction. 

Somehow I thought they were being sarcastic.

this is genius ... google needs to hire you 

&quot; hey Jim why does the floor say ppery?&quot; 

Inavation that excites

You just watched this didn&#39;t you 
Water + hydrophobic coatings - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif</a>

...why not just paint the whole surface with it?
And make planes out of the black box stuff.

Yeah I&#39;ve seen that gif too, and that paint wears off fairly quickly sooooooo

Or they’ll read “lip” 

I need my girlfriend to get a tattoo like this. 

Good idea, quite ingenious.

The Pratt &amp; Whitney campus in CT has temperature sensitive signs that show white when it&#39;s freezing to warn of ice. 

It would have to say it on every square inch to cover any possible spills.....

Did you fall in the shower?

you’d have to write “slippy” here in pittsburgh 😳

Why? 

Hydrophobic coatings and paint don&#39;t tend to be very durable. So it would be rather expensive to maintain.

Some people pointed out issues with this idea but one I could think of is if a floor is waxed. If the floor was ever waxed again, then the hydrophobic paint would need to be reapplied over the wax. Also I&#39;m not sure the paint would give the look you&#39;re trying to achieve on these types of surfaces.

Can&#39;t they just completely cover them in hydrophobic paint, so they will stay dry and not be slippery to begin with?

Brilliant 

is hydrophobic paint really a thing?

You may have missed <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif" rel="nofollow">this</a> which has been (re)posted a number of times

smaht

I go to a university in North Carolina and freshman year, my friend Brent spray painted the word &quot;moist&quot; on a sidewalk span of about 6 feet in clear hydrophobic paint. I chuckled every time it rained (which was a lot; were on the east coast).

I&#39;ve found a value to convert:<ul><li>6.0ft is equal to 1.83m or 9.61 bananas</li></ul>

My buddy and I used a sealant to graffiti our town streets so when it rains you can see it. Problem is we live in LA so it rains like 4 days a year.

The liquor store by my house has permanent wet floor cones out. I always found it funny, but I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t when they get sued anyways because of the meaningless cones. 

I worked retail and one time I caught these kids spraying Armour-All on the tile floor. Needless to say it was slippery.

I look forward to hearing about this crappy design idea on 99 percent invisible ten years from now

That is one slick idea!

Or make sure they aren’t slippery. But idk

Why not something that was hygroscopic?

Nah, facilities managers would rather stick 2 foot high a-frames in the middle of the walkway so that you will surely trip and fall. Much more sadistic that way.

I&#39;ve found a value to convert:<ul><li>2.0ft is equal to 0.61m or 3.2 bananas</li></ul>

Uhhhh...thanks. I guess?

<a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/rRIoPVO" rel="nofollow">https://m.imgur.com/gallery/rRIoPVO</a>

Aren&#39;t hydrophobic surfaces with a tiny bit of water on them super slippery? Also I think they are quite delicate so they would get ground off by people walking there pretty quickly. 

They should use paint that&#39;s invisible when Dry but when it gets wet a watermark becomes visible that says slippery

Wouldn&#39;t that just make the water bead away from the paint? 

Ya but on concrete it will work. On a grocery store floor?   Not gonna show up. 

And become more slippery in the process?

Except when the 15 yr old working the mop gets lazy, revealing a mere “pery”. Someone falls, sued.

Well what if only half the word is wet so all I see is “pery”

If the text wasn’t fully exposed then people would just read “slip”?

Or you just assume all wet floors are slippery SMH Come on.

That’s kind of brilliant. 

Wouldn&#39;t it also make it way more slippery?

If it only gets wet in a certain area people will be informed of ‘pery’! “I guess he must be employee of the month or someth... Aaaahhhh! My back!!”

Would have saved me a concussion. Good idea!

Unless it&#39;s only slippery in a tiny spot and the while word doesn&#39;t show up and then someone falls trying to figure out what the word is  

Say we use a hydrophobic dye in the wax of a store floor. When wet it changes color. It wouldn&#39;t be very useful for the average visitor but it could be great at quickly identifying spills or slippery areas. 

Or... Make the entire surface hydrophobic so it never gets wet to begin with.

I used hydrochromic paint in college for a project, it’s really not very good stuff. Not nearly as good as thermochromic stuff. 

Sir, do you mean hydrochromatic paint? Colour changing instead of water repellent?

Paint is really slippery when it is when, which would only make conditions worse.

So the paint is afraid of water?

or they could just coat the whole sidewalk

It’s been done

For sure 

Theyd have to find a floor that could be painted on that would show the warning very clearly because not everyone looks at the floor all the time

A few thoughts , if your paying enough attention to see that the floor says something, you likely already know that it&#39;s wet, the signs that stick up are way more visible from a long distance than words flat on a shiny floor, by the time you could read it your already on the slippery bit.

They already do this sometimes. In fact it was posted on Reddit multiple times, which is probably where you stole this from.

This isn&#39;t a good idea at all. It&#39;ll only tell you if that specific area is wet. It might be dry there and wet 2 feet away

I&#39;ve found a value to convert:<ul><li>2.0ft is equal to 0.61m or 3.2 bananas</li></ul>

Bruh, you&#39;re living in 3018!

*in <em>clear</em> hydrophobic paint
(FTFY for easier comprehensibility.)

Someone is gonna pee on the sidewalks drunk 

Or when the floor is only partially wet it&#39;ll read lippy

Or you could just put up a wet floor stand sign for like a zillionth of the cost.

You see? This is why people have those big houses. 

Isn&#39;t ceramic already hydrophobic?

Plot twist:  Hydrophobic spray paint makes the floor not slippery.  /s

I just assume shit is slippery when it&#39;s wet.

If by shower thoughts you mean stuff you think while browsing reddit
Water + hydrophobic coatings<a href="https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/pR4wcHd.gif</a>

Why not just assume that everything is slippery when wet???

Why not just coat the floors so they&#39;re never wet

Or you know, when it&#39;s wet, be careful because it&#39;s slippery.

OP has this thought then immediately slips in shower.

So, it&#39;ll say &quot;slippery&quot; when wet.

The more I think about this idea, the worse it gets

This guy is going places...

Why can&#39;t anyone just assume is slippery when it rains 

I first read it as homophobic paint ... I was about to say, what&#39;s wrong with gays? Lol

ITT people taking a shower thought too seriously.

They should stop making shop floors, sidewalks, roads and stairs of the material, which can become slippery under any conditions.

They should write “slippy” instead and save some money on paint.

How am I supposed to fall and collect my insurance money

Won&#39;t work if it&#39;s an oil spill

This doesn&#39;t make any sense as a safety measure for obvious reasons, but it does make for clever street art. 

Not to mention you&#39;d have to write &quot;slippery&quot; a bunch of times over the entire surface area of the floor, because it&#39;s not like you can predict where exactly the spill will be...

That&#39;s why we have one of those irobot vacuums come out, but instead of cleaning up the spill, it tags a slippery stencil around the area in hydrophobic paint.

What about people who can&#39;t read or don&#39;t know English? Use a symbol like on a wet floor sign. 

If they could do that, why not just coat them so they aren&#39;t slippery?

They should do this in urinals so you can paint a pucture while you pee

I&#39;m glad Elon Musk didn&#39;t post his SpaceX thoughts here for peer &quot;review&quot; back in the day...

Hydrophobic surfaces are extra slippery though. You will increase the danger.

How can it get wet if it&#39;s covered n hydrophobic paint?

It would say slippery when wet

A partially wet floor may only reveal the word slip.  An invitation?  Better put up a disclaimer sign next it but put it a stand of some kind so it doesn’t get wet... or slip.

The yellow sign union will never let that happen 

If it&#39;s just a small puddle that only covers &quot;Slip-&quot;, does that mean the store is instructing me to sue them?

I’m waiting for a Migos meme.

Imagine walking down the street as it starts to drizzle a bit and seeing the word &quot;slippery&quot; just ominously appear in front of you

They should write, &quot;Ground is dangerously hot&quot; on the asphalt in heat sensitive paint so pet owners know to protect their furry ones.

Why not just cover them with the hydrophobic paint? Then there&#39;s no need to paint the warning because they won&#39;t be wet

Why do you want to make people fall over?

TIL there is such a thing as hydrophobic paint

You 

Hydrophobic coatings are usually create microscopic surface features, like lotus leaves have. These would wear off though.

That&#39;s awesome.  It&#39;s perfect for shinny surfaces and white boats when it&#39;s hard to tell and you don&#39;t want ugly signage all over the place.  You should niche that idea into the boat product market.  There&#39;s hundred of millions of dollars in that industry.  For boat safety commercial and consumer, world wide? Billions. 

Excuse me. Please me.

If you&#39;re going to the trouble of putting something down. Why not just put something on there that makes it not slippery?

OP you do realize that hydrophobic paint is slippery when wet right?
