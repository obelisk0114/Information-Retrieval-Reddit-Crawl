This is the example of plagiarism.

To steal from many is research... unless you don‚Äôt cite your sources. Then it‚Äôs still plagiarism


WanderingBuffal0     Sun Feb 4 18:56:34 2018 UTC

Cite. And yes. Agreed

I am pretty sure that the creators of Trivial Pursuit did not acknowledge their sources until after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit#Fred_Worth_lawsuit" rel="nofollow">they were sued for copyright violation</a> but they still won because they had used multiple sources and their product was a completely different form than the books they had used for research.

To research one person is stalking. 


dogecorn     Sun Feb 4 23:30:06 2018 UTC

To research many it&#39;s caled studying 


James-Sylar     Sun Feb 4 15:44:25 2018 UTC

You cite others when you do research, those ideas and investigation are from them and you are saying so in your work, so readers can look at them, kind of like publicity. You are stealing if you say that those ideas and investigation were yours, and while it is possible you didn&#39;t know it was done previously, then you would have to demonstrate that you did the whole thing by yourself. 


half3clipse     Sun Feb 4 21:23:28 2018 UTC

Not only that, but citing them actually helps them. A paper that half the field is citing is a pretty valuable feather for a scientist to put in their cap.

This is so wrong it hurts my head.

Thats...not how that works...


DestructiveHat     Sun Feb 4 21:05:45 2018 UTC

Citation isn&#39;t stealing.


xTopperBottoms     Sun Feb 4 23:01:30 2018 UTC

How did this get so many upvotes? 


piersplows     Sun Feb 4 21:22:49 2018 UTC

It&#39;s all about whether you attribute the ideas to others or not, not whether they come from single/many.

Reminds me of another saying,
Take inspiration you&#39;ll be known as being similar to them, take inspiration from many and you&#39;ll be known as original.

What you describe is writing a review article or a book chapter, which is perfectly fine, but nothing you&#39;ll build much of an academic career on doing over and over.

Spoken as someone who doesn‚Äôt do research lol. That‚Äôs not what research is, man


smileymn     Sun Feb 4 20:13:13 2018 UTC

This is incredibly true in music. 
Edit: All the best musicians steal ideas from many, but if you only steal from 1-2 you‚Äôre a copycat.


GraniteOverworld     Sun Feb 4 21:12:28 2018 UTC

Yep yep. Many songs I write are an amalgamation of several different songs or artists. Take a little bit of a one song structure, change up the note progression or the scales, and alter the arrangement and boom, &quot;New&quot; song. There&#39;s no shame in it, really, it&#39;s basically how all art is created.
I still believe the only absolutely new ideas come from artists with mental illnesses, since they&#39;re minds put things together in a way we&#39;d never think of. Look up the art of Louis Wain. He was an early 20th century painter who mostly painted pictures of cats, but he had schizophrenia and you can slowly watch the progression from regular old paintings of cats to absolutely deranged, almost psychedelic interpretations of the same thing. 


smileymn     Sun Feb 4 21:22:01 2018 UTC

The Shaggs are a good example of Musicians creating music out of a void. Completely untrained Musicians trying to write and play their own original rock music.
John Cage had truly unique ideas and his contemporaries Wolff, Brown and Feldman, by trying to ‚Äúget rid of the glue in music that is harmony, melody and rhythm.‚Äù
There are truly unique and incredible musicians and composers everywhere but you can almost always trace their influences and where they are coming from. What‚Äôs unique to me is how people hybridize different ideas into new ideas (cross genre, cross culture, combining very old ideas with very new ideas, stealing from non musical sources like literature or visual art).


GraniteOverworld     Sun Feb 4 21:35:45 2018 UTC

Sometimes observing influences and processes is just as interesting as the music itself. 


fuzzyfrank     Sun Feb 4 23:53:33 2018 UTC

This is true for any art, I feel


mbtk     Sun Feb 4 23:54:03 2018 UTC

That is me in a nutshell. I&#39;d rather talk about how to make music than actually make it üòÇ


mbtk     Sun Feb 4 23:50:55 2018 UTC

The question is, is that kind of self awareness necessary or even helpful to the musician? I want to add that genres illustrate this perfectly - a group of artists all warming themselves and each other around the same fire. I fuck with composing too, and the awareness of calibrated plagiarism you describe is a double edged sword - you don&#39;t have to worry about whether your music is original, however it does take some of the fun out of coming up with stuff, since you become aware of just how much of it is actually &#39;your&#39; idea. 


GraniteOverworld     Sun Feb 4 23:55:12 2018 UTC

It&#39;s kinda funny, sometimes I&#39;m aware of it and other times I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve written a few songs before where after the fact I realized exactly where the ideas came from. Other times I realize it while playing or writing, but I end up liking the idea enough that I try to tweak it til it has more of my own imprint on it. 
I&#39;ve gotten pretty far beyond worrying if my music is original, it&#39;s a stressful thing to have on the mind. I aim for making music that&#39;s fresh, stuff that though it might exist, it&#39;s not something you hear as often.

Do you think if Carlos Mencia just cited his sources he would&#39;ve been okay?

mbtk     Sun Feb 4 23:38:55 2018 UTC

This is a fact of the universe, not just academia - all original works are clarifications of a set of prior works. The cells in your body are even included under this definition.

I find it really weird how hard it is to plagiarize math topics

Research = learning from a source and using that knowledge to make something
Plagiarism = taking the actual content from the source, even if you cite it


Pukesmiley     Mon Feb 5 01:18:34 2018 UTC

You stole that idea and the exact text from one person
