(Except for the cost of the glasses)

Last time I checked, trips to the optometrist aren&#39;t free either.  

Social healthcare, do you speak it??

Opticians will probably market this as a reason to buy expensive glasses now... 

My eyes weren&#39;t bad when I was little so if I go back and play Spyro I bet it&#39;ll look the same

but... but... glasses aren&#39;t cheap!

Haha so true man good post
