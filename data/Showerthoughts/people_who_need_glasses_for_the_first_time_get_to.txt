(Except for the cost of the glasses)


DrPierreChang     Sun Feb 4 08:56:17 2018 UTC

Last time I checked, trips to the optometrist aren&#39;t free either.

Social healthcare, do you speak it??


Krenth_KH     Sun Feb 4 14:39:37 2018 UTC

No, my friend, he doesn&#39;t... He&#39;s &#39;Murican...


B0redBread     Sun Feb 4 23:06:05 2018 UTC

am European (German to be precise) had to pay for the glasses out of pocket


neomorphivolatile     Sun Feb 4 15:33:01 2018 UTC

Social healthcare? Free? Dumb socialists.

Chill chill no need to flame

Opticians will probably market this as a reason to buy expensive glasses now...

I recently got my eyes examined and found out I have a bad astigmatism. Got glasses, now I feel like I have to re-watch all my favorite movies and replay some games just to find out what I&#39;ve been missing. 


shewy92     Sun Feb 4 09:39:52 2018 UTC

My eyes weren&#39;t bad when I was little so if I go back and play Spyro I bet it&#39;ll look the same


Solarpoweredspaz     Sun Feb 4 15:08:35 2018 UTC

I promise it looks worse


shewy92     Sun Feb 4 15:15:45 2018 UTC

It won&#39;t because I bought the PSN version on PS3 and it is exactly as I remember it. 


RPFM     Sun Feb 4 18:12:08 2018 UTC

It looks SO much worse.. The PSN version does nothing. It&#39;s bad.


arthur-kirkland_70     Sun Feb 4 13:48:40 2018 UTC

but... but... glasses aren&#39;t cheap!


ed588     Sun Feb 4 15:01:41 2018 UTC

Mine were free. Depends what country you&#39;re in I guess


arthur-kirkland_70     Sun Feb 4 15:02:06 2018 UTC

yup! america charges for everything


GreenDog3     Sun Feb 4 15:15:58 2018 UTC

Doesn’t help that most glasses companies are owned by Luxottica. 


arthur-kirkland_70     Sun Feb 4 15:16:29 2018 UTC

yeah, so they have a monopoly and can ramp up the prices for cheap glasses...


TheRedBow     Sun Feb 4 20:55:32 2018 UTC

And have prices easily 4-8 times the prices as in other countries where that bit you need to pay gets covered by insurance


LightReversal     Sun Feb 4 14:51:29 2018 UTC

When I first got my glasses I was pretty much overwhelmed by all the details I could now see in my surroundings (started with a -2). It wasnt quite the most pleasing experience at the beginning tho, I used to get slight headaches wearing new glasses, reading/staring on a screen was even worse + concentrating was fucking hard. 


Drui-Baxi     Sun Feb 4 14:50:41 2018 UTC

What if you&#39;ve never not had glasses? I&#39;ve been blind since kindergarten


GreenDog3     Sun Feb 4 15:16:25 2018 UTC

Than you get the classic version for free


TheRedBow     Sun Feb 4 20:55:53 2018 UTC

How are you redditing then?


Fylak     Sun Feb 4 15:17:02 2018 UTC

Honestly games didn&#39;t improve all that much for me. I needed glasses since I was really young but didn&#39;t get them until I was in I think fourth grade. I just thought that&#39;s how people saw. Anyway I always sat close to the TV to play games because that&#39;s where I could see it, and I always thought it was really unrealistic how you could still see so clearly far away (this was around the start of the ps2 era). The pixels didn&#39;t get any further away so if I was close enough to see the foreground, the background would be just as clear (as it would be for everyone else at least) 


Bowfire5     Sun Feb 4 15:35:59 2018 UTC

Actually, wearing glasses is the same as normal vision, without them is below average, so it really is more of a downside that you always need them.


UnkreativerJunge     Sun Feb 4 17:51:50 2018 UTC

No, I am able to see everything perfectly fine up tom 30cm away


Skystrike7     Sun Feb 4 21:06:55 2018 UTC

I have myopia so gaming was totally unaffected by my glasses acquisition.


TacoTrip     Sun Feb 4 22:25:29 2018 UTC

I just got glasses recently. I can attest to this. I wanted a bigger TV but glasses were cheaper. I can now see the difference between HD and SD. 


Muzzy637     Mon Feb 5 00:57:08 2018 UTC

Trip to the optometrist: $10Lenses: $50Actual lenses that aren’t pieces of shit: $150Frames: $69Frames that look good and fit your face and don’t give you a headache: $220Seeing clearly and not getting tired all the time from constantly having to focus your eyes: priceless 


pgbabse     Mon Feb 5 00:58:51 2018 UTC

Glasses remove nature&#39;s antialiasing 


HankyPanksassin     Sun Feb 4 09:39:26 2018 UTC
