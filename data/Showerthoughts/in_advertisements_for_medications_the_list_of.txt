I support this solely for how hilariously long the &quot;this medication will kill you&quot; segment of ever pharmaceutical commercial will be. It&#39;s already pretty fucking long; this would make it perfect.

Or we could just stop advertising for medications.

Yes! I can&#39;t believe the US allows brand advertising of medications. Stop monetizing health!

I would bet that lots of clinical trials don&#39;t have enough participants to say, accurately and with confidence, what percentage of people reported a side effect.

They do that on German medications - there&#39;s a list in each package showing the percentages reported

And here in the UK too.
