I’m waiting for this moment in the future where I sit around thinking about nothing and suddenly realize that the schrodinger meme has died. You postponed that moment for me.

the schrodinger meme is both alive and dead until you see a post with it and check the comments.

I suppose the same thinking applies to a lot of things. Like health checkups and lottery tickets. You&#39;ll only truly lose when you confirm it.

Not really -- it already is either good or bad news, and your choice not to look at it because it might be bad news puts you in the state of assuming it is bad news but hoping it isn&#39;t.
