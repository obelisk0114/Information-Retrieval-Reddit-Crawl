I&#39;ve noticed how the days of asking if asking a celebrity you find in public for an autograph has went away. People pretty much just want selfies now. I can&#39;t blame them. I genuinely don&#39;t get the appeal of having a celebrity write their name for you. Plus, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s more convenient for the celebrity as well because smiling really quick for a selfie is easier than writing your name 100 times.
