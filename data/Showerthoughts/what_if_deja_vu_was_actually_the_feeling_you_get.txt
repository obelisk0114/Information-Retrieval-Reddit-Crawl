surfyturkey     Sat Feb 3 07:56:51 2018 UTC

My deja vu is when real life matches a dream I had. Right when the moment hits I can actually recall the dream like it’s a memory so I like to think my dreams are me looking into the future and once it happens in real life it’s like I caught up to that very moment and it lets me know I’m exactly where I am supposed to be


JankGloriousJank     Sat Feb 3 14:06:25 2018 UTC

Check out the idea of Déjà Rêvé, literally &quot;to have dreamed before&quot;. Very similar concept to Déjà Vu, but relates specifically to remembered dreams!


pitchblack1138     Sat Feb 3 16:00:02 2018 UTC

I used to get that like once a month when I was a kid but since I hit my 20s I haven&#39;t experienced it at all. I miss it. It was weird but reassuring in a way. 


Beddgelert     Sat Feb 3 20:12:38 2018 UTC

You are the last version of you still in play across the nearby multiverse. Take great care. You will be needed.


rlicopter     Sat Feb 3 20:32:09 2018 UTC

My Whole family experiences this phenomenon. Once every 3 or 4 months. Nobody knew what was going on until the first of us was diagnosed with epilepsy. The feeling of intense Deja Vu is actually a pretty common symptom of focal seizures. if it happens again, I&#39;d suggest a visit to a neurologist.


Turbodiesel67     Sat Feb 3 22:52:03 2018 UTC

Seriously? I&#39;ve had deja vu many times per year throughout my life with no ill effects


BrieDotDotDot     Sat Feb 3 13:52:15 2018 UTC

Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!


gettheromacrust     Sat Feb 3 17:45:23 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve experienced this quite a bit and have tight that my brain was just going through the most likely scenarios I would be facing in the coming days. 
It&#39;s always something mundane when it happens. Ours never like meeting a new person I&#39;ve never seen except in a dream. It&#39;s usually dealing with something at work


IntrepidWalrus     Sun Feb 4 02:48:44 2018 UTC

Thats was what I thought it was too! It was also an encounter with my close friends too


flippinfilippus     Sat Feb 3 17:51:50 2018 UTC

dude me too!! and it&#39;s regardless of the ridiculousness of the dream. the essence, or that one moment, is still the same 


EssKelly     Sat Feb 3 18:39:45 2018 UTC

The same thing has happened to me a lot. 
I read somewhere that there’s some science behind why this [might] happen. IIRC, occasionally the visual inputs/signals that are taken in by our optic nerves aren’t processed correctly/quickly enough by the brain. As a result, the brain kinda freezes up, and “backs up” to process the wonky signal, which our waking conscious chalks up to “oh I had a dream about this.” 
I’ll try to find the link. 
Edit: <a href="https://examinedexistence.com/how-does-deja-vu-work-the-science-behind-deja-vu/" rel="nofollow">source</a> Might be caused by the lobes of the brain processing memories/situations “out of order” 


BizzyM     Sat Feb 3 22:50:30 2018 UTC

I remember reading an article that postulated that there is a chemical marker (or something) stored with memories that deteriorates over time.  When you recall memories, the deterioration of this marker helps you to guess the age of the memory.  Deja vu is thought to happen when real-time events are paired with a marker that isn&#39;t 100% &quot;fresh&quot; so it feels like a slightly aged memory, but it&#39;s happening now, which causes the strange feeling.


Scone_Survivor     Sat Feb 3 17:38:01 2018 UTC

Are you me? This exact thing happens enough that I began to think that as well. I can recall almost all of the events because I&#39;ve experienced them twice.


Bandaloopin     Sat Feb 3 20:03:14 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve documented countless instances of this in my life and others. It&#39;s wild


middaymovies     Sat Feb 3 20:17:36 2018 UTC

That exact thing happens to me!!!!! I dream the moment and then completely forget (or cant describe it) then it happens and I&#39;m like &quot;oh! That&#39;s who that person is!&quot; I never heard of anyone else this happened to :)


DUMPAH_CHUCKER_69     Sat Feb 3 20:23:41 2018 UTC

This happens because you have two separate memory storing systems in your brain. One is for the immediate and one files it away for memories. Normally they act in unison, but every now and then they get out of sync which causes Deja Vu. 
At least I’m pretty sure that’s how it happens, it’s been a minute since I learned it. There is a Vsauce video on it though. 


Temmie65     Sat Feb 3 23:05:59 2018 UTC

When that happens my brain tingles 


Darjian     Sat Feb 3 23:24:31 2018 UTC

Thank the gods I&#39;m not the only one. Every time I tell my experience to people I&#39;m close to they tell me I&#39;m nuts. The craziest one I had happened a few hours after I dreamt it.


wsoj     Sun Feb 4 00:19:03 2018 UTC

I’ve had weirdly specific dreams about things I’ve never done before that I then realise I’ve dreamed about when I experience them including odd details, it’s always insignificant events too. 


cmclav     Sun Feb 4 00:37:49 2018 UTC

A few years ago I had a dream I watched a kid on a bike with a helmet on got hit by a car.. Few weeks later it happened!

I thought it was the matrix resetting itself? Has tv lied to me?


sn0mam     Sat Feb 3 15:59:24 2018 UTC

Not resetting itself, but a sign that agents have made changes in the matrix. The repeated act is the program filling in empty space/data left by said changes. It&#39;s really not too far fetched to me


steve_of     Sat Feb 3 13:04:28 2018 UTC

Deja vu is the brain equivalent of memory leakage. Basically you are &#39;remembering&#39; in real time.

Deja Vu is when you reload to an autosave point because you died. This is a simulation.

Fatal_Error87     Sat Feb 3 12:56:02 2018 UTC

Here is the weird part. I remember remembering the deja vu. So I would see a vision of that and think, oh weird I don&#39;t have that car, or I don&#39;t know this house and then the deja vu moment would happen irl and I would remember I had thought those things but I own that car or that house now. I don&#39;t remember what comes next either I just know when the moment is over. 
My theory is much like the Futurama episode where they keep going forward in time and everything essentially repeats itself. Deja vu is almost like a deep rooted memory in the atoms that make you up since they will most likely be the same atoms. 


NachoNormalAccount     Sat Feb 3 18:36:04 2018 UTC

Ive experienced this very often throughout my life, and even discussed it before. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/75o6tv/z/do972z6" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/intrusivethoughts/comments/75o6tv/z/do972z6</a>
The visions can be life altering, or mundane, but they always make me stop and go woah.
I still havent formulated a good theory on it, the closest i can come up with is either that past lives exist, as do alternate timelines/realities, and we are seeing bleed through; or, that enough variables in the universe are known at the instant of the vision subconsciously, enough to very very accurately determine what is going to happen at a specific instant in time.
Science doesnt really believe in the possibility of past lives, or really alternate realities, sure there are postulations of them, but its a &quot;tinfoil hat&quot; type thing. Science also says that its near impossible to exactly know the future, because of the number of variables that are needed to do so are astronomical. 


genericdudejks     Sun Feb 4 00:35:04 2018 UTC

Science doesn’t say it’s impossible to know the future. Einstein, for example, postulated that our way of perceiving time is a stubborn illusion and that it should be possible to directly view the future. (And not just plugging in a bunch of variables to get a possible version of what could happen.)


NotJimBenOrSpencer     Sun Feb 4 02:56:47 2018 UTC

&quot;Rimmer, you just came in here and said exactly these things... you said that! And That! And then you said somethin&#39; like &#39;maybe it IS deja vu&#39;... Go on, shake your head and walk out.&quot;

90sFlip     Sat Feb 3 16:13:02 2018 UTC

As an epileptic, people normally ask me if I’m sensitive to light patterns. I’ve never had a seizure due to strobing lights. Having a deja vu is what triggers my seizures. I get an overwhelming feeling of depersonalization, and honestly it feels quite amazing. I feel as if I’ve lived everything before and that I am not really “myself.” A real scary and overwhelming feeling, but still weirdly ecstatic. This lasts for about 30 seconds - 1 minute. Then I blackout and seize collapsing into the ground which is the (very) shitty part.It’s weird that I grew up thinking I was special, but it turns out this shit happens to a lot of people.


CptBlackBird     Sat Feb 3 21:31:46 2018 UTC

I used to be epileptic, whenever I had those moments my head always started to feel warm and fuzzy and had a feeling that someone was tickling my face. It was both good and bad like you said


_meiki     Sat Feb 3 16:06:32 2018 UTC

I heard recently that one of the most supported theories for deja vu comes down to that fact we have two hemispheres to our brain. Something like the memory pathway is initiated in one side, but then is communicated to the other side; except the strongest pathways are still in just one hemisphere, thus, the experience existing outside the recollection/the deja vu. Or did I dream about hearing this?


Dany182     Sat Feb 3 18:23:08 2018 UTC

No you didn’t. I heard it too.


wonkey_monkey     Sat Feb 3 21:44:56 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t remember it being about hemispheres, just that sometimes new stuff goes straight into long-term storage and then you &quot;remember&quot; it straight away.


GenXer1977     Sat Feb 3 17:31:17 2018 UTC

No, I think it&#39;s more likely time traveler&#39;s messing with the past.  Someone goes back and changes something, then some kind of timecop goes back and changes it back to what it was, then we here in the present get back on the original timeline and it causes us a moment of deja vu.  


cookieshabang     Sun Feb 4 00:01:07 2018 UTC

Years before the actually deja vu moment happened once, I had a dream that I was smoking with my cousin and friend at the friends house. I remeber participating in the conversation and then we got in the car to go to Wal-Mart. We had an accident and died. Then fast forward to the ACTUAL moment and it all comes back to me. So I just sit quietly at the table. We go to Wal-Mart but I was determined to stay quiet. And I lived. I truly believed that was a reset point. And I remembered because it wasn&#39;t supposed to be my time. I can still remeber both very vividly 7 years later.

Wouldn’t you just constantly feel deja vu then?


BrieDotDotDot     Sat Feb 3 13:56:51 2018 UTC

I think you make so many choices in a given day beginning with waking up (before, upon, or after snoozing the alarm, for example) that your timelines would naturally split and converge at very different spots in time. You might end up in the same place around 9am or something, but slightly early or late or facing a different direction, etc. 


Yum_catshit     Sat Feb 3 15:37:50 2018 UTC

What if?


neostrike3     Sat Feb 3 16:20:01 2018 UTC

But with  the different timeline theory.  It&#39;s assumed there is an infinite amount of timelines doing everything possible. So using your Deja vu theory then we should be having deja vu 24/7


davidb1959     Sat Feb 3 16:20:08 2018 UTC

There’s a good sci-fi novel called The Man Who Folded Himself that pulls a great group of “timeline variables” as its main premise. Its out of print but copies can be found on Amazon eBay etc the author was David Gerrold.

LargeLearningcurve     Sat Feb 3 20:21:27 2018 UTC

Whenever I have deja vu, I&#39;m recalling moments that I feel like I&#39;ve already been through, the only thing is that the moments I&#39;m recalling  are usually situations that turned out bad.  
So the effect of the DV is a warning in a sense, although nothing like a Spider-Man sense, keeping me from immediate incoming physical danger.  More like I heard or saw something that triggered a general memory I can&#39;t quit latch onto about a thing going wrong at work, in a social setting, etc.  For instance, I&#39;m on my way to work and I know inherently something went wrong, so once I get there and someone says there was trouble with electrical turnstiles and key pads, I automatically back up all my files &amp; boom the power goes out.  Had I not had this DV, i would have just ignored that office chatter/banter/whatever.
One of my biggest issues though, is when I have DV about a situation or issue I may have caused, that then gives me anxiety, much more than if I didn&#39;t cause the negative effect.  The last time I had this happen was a few weeks ago, I just had a large amount of some pretty caffeinated coffee, which can enhance anxiety on its own, paired with the anxiety from the &quot;forethought/deja vu&quot; and I was not in a good space.  I think I was headed towards a panic attack, but I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never had one that I know of.  As I write this, it&#39;s sounds kinda crazy, but is definitely my experience.
Edit for clarity.

EleAnon     Sat Feb 3 21:03:25 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t know, the most that happens is that i&#39;m in a circumstance that i&#39;m sure i have been in before, but that&#39;s it. Like walking back to the dorm after shopping and suddenly &quot;wtf, why is this specific moment familiar to me&quot;

BrokenEye3     Sun Feb 4 06:55:09 2018 UTC

It&#39;s something like that, but with brain timelines instead of universe timelines. It&#39;s what happens when the brain notices that it&#39;s experiencing things a fraction of a second <em>after</em> the sensory organs do, but is unable to accept that what it thinks is happening <em>right now</em>  actually happened a fraction of a second ago, and decides that the exact same thing must have happened twice, completely without variation, and it just doesn&#39;t remember the first time, because yeah, <em>that</em> makes sense.
