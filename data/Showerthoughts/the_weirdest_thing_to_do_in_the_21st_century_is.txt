Hingehead     Sun Feb 4 15:12:06 2018 UTC

I remember watching Saved By The Bell when I was really young and thinking that teenagers just walked into each others&#39; bedroom windows at random.


horseseathey     Sun Feb 4 21:01:30 2018 UTC

I know, right? I did that to my girlfriend once and it scared the shit out of her. Totally thought it was romantic. 


Shermer26     Sun Feb 4 22:56:09 2018 UTC

It was so unexpected because she didn&#39;t know she was someone&#39;s girlfriend.


saltesc     Mon Feb 5 00:24:21 2018 UTC

Hey, babe! It&#39;s me, your boyfriend.

Shippoyasha     Sun Feb 4 23:04:23 2018 UTC

Some close families and culture still does that. Probably helps to make that a ground rule first though.


Nixie9     Mon Feb 5 00:31:52 2018 UTC

This was fairly normal before smartphones. I had a good friend at uni that used to climb in my window at night and set up a bed on the floor, I had a camping mat and duvet in a roll for him that he could grab, and often woke up to him on the floor. 
Now if I woke up with even my best friend in the bedroom I would full on freak out, I wouldn&#39;t even answer my door to them if they didn&#39;t text first.


Pioneerpie26     Mon Feb 5 00:28:36 2018 UTC

Kinda happened with me. I remember waking up numerous times to my friends calling me a lazy shithead and to hurry up and get ready 


Racer20     Sun Feb 4 15:23:24 2018 UTC

Yet this happens on TV all the time. Get a break in the case?  Drive over to your partners house to tell them!


TravisPM     Sun Feb 4 20:28:21 2018 UTC

I think X Files was the first show to really integrate cell phones into the story.


surlygoat     Sun Feb 4 21:34:45 2018 UTC

Man cell phones are making things pretty dull, huh?


ToRagnarok     Sun Feb 4 22:26:42 2018 UTC

Some would say they’re making PEOPLE pretty dull. Am I right folks? 


Whatsthemattermark     Sun Feb 4 22:58:56 2018 UTC

If I wasn’t reading your comment on my cell phone right now I’d be staring at the wall and masturbating.
So yes, you’re right 


_Jolly_     Sun Feb 4 23:10:01 2018 UTC

I know right I always see this on tv and instantly think how unrealistic it is.


my_kids_gross     Sun Feb 4 18:51:00 2018 UTC

Meh, I got a couple of friends that we will just show up at each others houses if we are in the neighborhood and sit for a beer or two.  But also if I’m expected to be over at a certain time none of us knock, just open the door and call out while we walk in.  We’ve also known each other for 25+ years so that’s got something to do with it...


BMaclinFBI     Sun Feb 4 21:09:39 2018 UTC

I specifically tell my friends I’ll be there in an hour or so as I pull up. I like to keep them on their toes

I know you probably think it&#39;s amusing, but you do realize that that&#39;s actually extremely rude? And that there&#39;s like a 99.5% chance your friends are pretending it&#39;s &quot;Haha funny&quot; but actually think it&#39;s extremely annoying?
Ah nvm, I just checked your post history. You definitely give off the &quot;Obnoxious dudebro obsessed with sports&quot; vibe so you&#39;re just doing what naturally comes to you. Not really malicious intent I guess.
Hope you&#39;re enjoying the Superbowl, bud!


DamnableNook     Sun Feb 4 23:07:15 2018 UTC

It’s a pretty big stretch to go from “like sports” to “obnoxious dudebro”.
Ah nvm, I just checked your post history. You definitely give off the “bitter nerd who hates fun” vibe, so you’re just doing what naturally comes to you. /s


BrotherGreed     Sun Feb 4 23:26:53 2018 UTC

To be fair, I know people who as adults in their late 20s-mid 30s still play dumb high-school tier pranks on eachother all the time like this and think that it&#39;s fucking hysterical. That being said, I know some people that I wouldn&#39;t make a penis joke around because I know it would offend them. Different strokes.
Assuming that other people don&#39;t know their friends is kind of dumb and self-centered because you&#39;re assuming that you know what their friends do and don&#39;t like better than they do.


Daddy---Issues     Sun Feb 4 23:04:15 2018 UTC

touchdwnbundy     Sun Feb 4 21:21:38 2018 UTC

Same here and like you it&#39;s been 20+ years of knowing each other. I enjoy these random hang outs with friends. 


prattsbottom     Sun Feb 4 22:01:18 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve never known a front door that wasn&#39;t locked as soon as it closed...


ImTryingToBeNice_     Sun Feb 4 22:04:58 2018 UTC

Lol you must be kinda young.


prattsbottom     Sun Feb 4 22:13:44 2018 UTC

Yep, but also grew up in a city. And in response to <a href="/u/Dasamont">u/Dasamont</a> - it definitely means there&#39;s more of a risk of being locked out!


boredguy12     Sun Feb 4 22:24:42 2018 UTC

One of my old roommates liked to leave the back door open for some stupid reason. That all stopped quick when a wild dog nearly snuck into the house.


TheCheeseSquad     Sun Feb 4 22:47:14 2018 UTC

Sorry I like to prevent home invasions. Also am a woman. Being young has zilch to do with it; my 50 year old parents lock the door. 


Theycallmemrlurker     Sun Feb 4 23:12:10 2018 UTC

You see tho, doors only stop honest people. If someone is going to rob you, the door / window isn&#39;t stopping them. A .44 magnum will tho 


TheCheeseSquad     Sun Feb 4 23:24:44 2018 UTC

There is zero reason to make it any easier for them. And you must have some seriously weak doors if you&#39;re actually being unironic.


Theycallmemrlurker     Mon Feb 5 01:14:47 2018 UTC

Well over 90% of doors used for homes can be quietly broken into using a small crowbar. And if it&#39;s not a metal door, chances ar are you can break in with a kick. The problem with solid doors isn&#39;t that they are weak, it is that the vast majority of the time the frame is weak, or the screws used are shitty 3/4&quot; screws. Wanna make your home secure? Replace your screws. As for security, I only lock my door when I am asleep or not there . Stupid maybe but I&#39;m not worried about being robbed. 


BrotherGreed     Sun Feb 4 23:33:37 2018 UTC

Yeah, but that statement is meant assuming that someone is hell-bent on robbing <strong>you</strong> and not just robbing the easiest person that seems to have something worth stealing.
All it takes is for someone to come up to your door to pretend to drop off a leaflet and see that you might have something nice worth stealing in your foyer, try the door quietly, dip in, snatch it, and dip out before you even have time to check out the noise, if you&#39;re even around to hear it.
Or are you convinced that the only burglaries are ones where they try to violently break into your house to completely clean you out?


NurseMcStuffins     Mon Feb 5 00:13:14 2018 UTC

Depends on location and upbringing. We are pretty young, don&#39;t lock our door until we are going to bed usually. Our parents were the same way. But we have friends that lock their religiously as soon as someone closes the door. 


Dasamont     Sun Feb 4 22:04:50 2018 UTC

That seems inconvenient, but also quite safe


TwoSevenOne     Sun Feb 4 22:28:00 2018 UTC

Me too but it&#39;s usually because they don&#39;t want me coming back.


OurSaviorBenFranklin     Sun Feb 4 22:36:32 2018 UTC

In college if one of my roommates was home the door was never locked and our buddies would just walk over and walk in at their pleasure. If they tried to open the door and it was locked they would text us asking when we would be home. Fun times having the party house. 


gkaplan59     Sun Feb 4 22:08:43 2018 UTC

Was there a show on NBC about you in the 90s?


HookedOnPhoenix_     Sun Feb 4 21:33:55 2018 UTC

Yeah, my best bud knows the code for the front door. He just comes in, no big deal.


chevymonza     Sun Feb 4 21:12:23 2018 UTC

As a kid, we used to run around, knock on doors, ask if other kids could come out to play. If not, next!
Then we moved, and the neighbors looked at us like we were insane. In <em>that</em> neighborhood, you would <em>call</em> apparently. WTF.


pizzaqveen     Sun Feb 4 22:39:33 2018 UTC

I used to do this too. My cousin lived down the street and his house was the &quot;hangout&quot; house for the neighborhood kids. We would just show up or wait on their porch. 


TAStheResidentArtist     Sun Feb 4 22:13:28 2018 UTC

Yeah! A year ago or so, I was in the neighborhood and I drove to my friends house to see how he was doing and he said “text me next time” and I thought that was sooo rude xD 


qigger     Mon Feb 5 00:45:37 2018 UTC

I used to love this part of childhood. I&#39;m kind of sad my kids will never experience it.
I&#39;m at that age too where we all had pagers and to meet up we&#39;d have to go to someone&#39;s house (unlikely) or figure out which payphones in our city could accept incoming calls and page and wait. Half the fun was the bullshish you&#39;d be doing while you waited to find out if that person could call back.
My wife is a few years younger and looks at me horrified when I tell her this.


chevymonza     Mon Feb 5 00:58:26 2018 UTC

Honestly!! We&#39;d be running all over the neighborhood, literally. 


CamelPriest     Sun Feb 4 15:34:38 2018 UTC

I always see people say how much better it was when it was socially acceptable to show up unannounced. Honestly, I am glad that is gone. Now, if someone messages me they are coming over I can tell them to wait a bit while I shower, clean myself up, and mentally prepare myself for social interaction.


Hingehead     Sun Feb 4 15:49:24 2018 UTC

I kind of like an unannounced visit. It is so random, always nice to have an unexpected someone to surprise you.  Then again, there are certain people I don&#39;t want to unexpectedly showing up at my doorstep either. 


Idiot6978     Sun Feb 4 16:09:27 2018 UTC

7jetta4     Sun Feb 4 20:28:40 2018 UTC

Ya the surprise makes them see the real you also helps you bond and pick better friends imo.


Frack12345667     Sun Feb 4 20:48:52 2018 UTC

Damm if only it was that easy. If someone messages me that we should hang out <strong>later this week</strong> I have a nervous breakdown and spend the whole day thinking about the best strategy to start thinking about cleaning up so I can at least make some progress before I even open iMessage and let them see the read receipt.

In college I rented a house with 4 other friends. Sometimes in summer one or two would live there and friends would occasionally visit. However, one summer for July 4 we all went to different places, and I get a text from a friend (who didn’t live there) asking where everyone was. Turns out he had driven 2 hours to surprise us cause he thought we were hosting a party there. Didn’t ask anyone beforehand, didn’t check around to see if anything else was going on, just jumped in his car and made the trip to drop in unnannounced. I felt bad we were all away and he made the trip for no reason, but at the same time mhbe you should have called ahead to make sure someone would be there.

In my experience, unexpected visitors are never bringing pie, good weed, scotch, or any other number of good things. They bring bad news, court summons, and little pieces of paper from judges saying it&#39;s OK to deprive me of my privacy and/or liberty. Or worst of all, missionaries.

There are people like me: I answer immediately to people I don&#39;t care much about because there&#39;s nothing to lose with them no matter what I say or how they feel about it - just doesn&#39;t matter to me. But if someone I care about sends me a message? Well then, first I need at least 10 minutes to enjoy my happiness that they even sent the message, followed by cooldown time from those good feelings so I can actually talk, and then some more time to think about what I will say. And after what could be an hour or more later, I will finally open the message.


le_GoogleFit     Sun Feb 4 23:31:58 2018 UTC

I get what you mean as I can do pretty much the same when it comes to talking to girls I like, but still that&#39;s a nice way of complicating things for no reason and make the other person quite confused as to why we take so much time to answer ;p


jemkills     Sun Feb 4 22:29:57 2018 UTC

Had a roommate/friend who did this. If we and our other roomie went out somewhere it eventually got where we made all of us do the cell phone in the center of the table thing. He and I were of the same opinion it was fucking rude. (It wasn&#39;t an, oh I got a text lemme check it, it was GLUED TO HER HAND) One time I asked what was so important and she says I&#39;m making plans with so and so. I was like, are you kidding....why don&#39;t you participate in the plans we made...that were trying to do....right now.


Thorgrin1     Sun Feb 4 23:28:16 2018 UTC

Fucking pisses me off when I see friends and people periodically checking their phone in front of me and yet when I text them, they don&#39;t fucking answer back. I get it if you are a super busy person with hundred of people texting you at the same time, you get the benefit of the doubt. Don&#39;t bullshit me when your life is not THAT hectic and you can&#39;t answer my text and yet you check your phone in front of me all the times. 
This and the fucking ghosting. 
Last decade mom&#39;s friend was stepmom to a kid I became friend with, we used to go a lot sporadically to their home. Sadly people change and disappear after moves. Summer of &#39;14, we invited him home for dinner but he was chatting on the phone all the time. That was about the last time I saw him...
You know how to surprise too? Send a postcard/letter. On my age bracket (&lt;25) it is very effective.
I had this online contact that I got on a seeking friends place, proposed experimentation and all novelty. Did have some messages and a call but he eventually ghosted. It is confusing because when he answered it was very casual. But never said NO to anything, just opted for silence.
I like Matrix, Black Mirror, cyberpunk; TL:DR To validate his identity, I happened to end doing a NSA/FBI agent internet search prior our contact and eventually got his adress. &lt;All from social media and google breadcrumbs!&gt;
I wonder if he got the nice postcard from NYC I sent mid January (we are in Europe).Ha!


Cathulion     Sun Feb 4 23:30:47 2018 UTC

But if your working and can&#39;t text, or driving, or something that&#39;s legitly keeping you busy, then your not obligated to respond. Silence means busy, text me later. 


iridiumsodacan     Sun Feb 4 21:51:46 2018 UTC

Not all of us want to be cyborgs.


mtothedubs     Sun Feb 4 20:57:30 2018 UTC

I miss the pop ins! Sometimes I just want to spontaneously drop by someone&#39;s place but my husband never lets me because he says nobody likes a &quot;pop in&quot;. But I do, so he is wrong. 


LintChrstmas     Sun Feb 4 23:18:45 2018 UTC

Irrefutable logic!


paddyspubofficial     Sun Feb 4 21:45:05 2018 UTC

As a young adult that works full time and has alot of college-aged friends, the pop in is weird. Between working 35-50 hrs a week, college course load, concerts, camping, and general social activity, the chances of that person being home when you choose to swing by are pretty slim. And if they are home they are most likely sleeping or doing homework/chores. It just seems very self-absorbed to swing by with no warning and just expect them to drop their important task to socialize with you.


tenderhart     Sun Feb 4 22:39:20 2018 UTC

I agree. It&#39;s funny, I seem to remember in my childhood (80s/90s) people were just home a lot more. My parents never went out. We lived in a small town, there was nothing to be out at except for the occasional church function. The neighbors were always on each other&#39;s porches or in each other&#39;s backyards, so even if you weren&#39;t home, you weren&#39;t far away. My family was also quite large, so there was a pretty good chance <em>somebody</em> would be home when somebody popped by.
I now live in a large city in a different country where this is absolutely not the norm, BUT some of my friends have recently decided to institute Dropping By as some kind of friendly hipster thing. I don&#39;t know if they do this to other friends or just me because I live next to the biggest supermarket on the southside of town which means they are actually &quot;in the neighborhood&quot; quite often to do their shopping. Could also be related to my recent divorce (they want to check in on me? see how I&#39;m doing?) We&#39;re all from different countries, so there&#39;s no cultural element, but I do definitely have quirky friends buzzing my apartment at random and it&#39;s pretty great. If I indicate that I got shit to do, then they politely stay for one coffee or tea and then head on their way.  Sometimes I get a quick text like &quot;hey, you home?&quot; but it is now not uncommon at all for me to receive an unannounced guest.
I&#39;m going to take a moment here to appreciate my friends.


VektaCity     Mon Feb 5 01:07:17 2018 UTC

Sounds like your life is pretty shit then...


paddyspubofficial     Mon Feb 5 01:22:30 2018 UTC

How so? I work a normal job, go to school and spend lots of time with my loved ones. Just because I&#39;m busy and never home doesn&#39;t mean my life is &quot;shit&quot; in any way.


inspectre_ecto     Sun Feb 4 22:19:46 2018 UTC

It&#39;s generational. I&#39;m thrilled when my friends pop over seldom as they do. 


Haener21     Sun Feb 4 21:04:48 2018 UTC

I’m actually a big fan of the pop in. My girlfriend and I do this all the time to our friends and family. We’ve found that most of friends and family are actually happy to be distracted from the chores they’re doing or tv they are watching. 


visioNteaM     Sun Feb 4 22:18:25 2018 UTC

All of my college housemates  and I graduated and moved back to our parents’ place in LA. My parents are always busy and never home. My housemates call me and tell me they’re out front. 


gerry_mandering_50     Sun Feb 4 23:24:09 2018 UTC

My housemates call me and tell me they’re out front. 
But knocking would be rude for some reason.


Ulivan     Sun Feb 4 20:10:40 2018 UTC

This is almost as weird as calling someone.


Hingehead     Sun Feb 4 20:14:57 2018 UTC

Not as weird and as anxiety crippling induceally as looking at other people, occupying the same time and space as your fellow species. 


churm92     Sun Feb 4 22:53:47 2018 UTC

Are you a bot? Half of your posts are literally &quot;The way you word an opinion is so hostile. We’re all just having fun talking about...&quot;
You&#39;re 3 years old. So either you&#39;re a really old bot or fucking weird. Like, honestly weird. I repeat some phrases sometimes but you repeated a post 17 times in a row (with come variations)
Are you ok?
Edit: Hope you don&#39;t mind if I RES tagged you, just curious to see if I notice the next time you spam copy/paste comments.


gerry_mandering_50     Sun Feb 4 23:22:41 2018 UTC

Be nice.


CoffeeStained-Studio     Mon Feb 5 00:45:11 2018 UTC

But dude literally has 17 copypasta posts in a row:

throw_a_way1512     Sun Feb 4 21:08:37 2018 UTC

I&#39;m close enough with this one family where I can come over unannounced. I even chill in their house when they aren&#39;t home and go in their pool and they literally think nothing of it when they come back home and see me there.I get bitched at for asking or telling them that im coming over lol


a_tale_of_wtf     Sun Feb 4 21:46:19 2018 UTC

No. No it isn&#39;t.


SubtleMockery     Sun Feb 4 21:59:28 2018 UTC

What about showing up unannounced, naked and covered in feces, quoting rocky horror picture show?


subyng     Sun Feb 4 22:12:03 2018 UTC

How is it the weirdest thing?


badmuther     Sun Feb 4 23:25:54 2018 UTC

Its not


topfoodie     Sun Feb 4 22:27:44 2018 UTC

My Vietnamese family used to do this a lot when I was a kid to family or family friends homes. Not until I was much older did I realize that it may have been weird to come over unannounced.


prevail_     Sun Feb 4 22:38:32 2018 UTC

Yesterday my wife showed up in the shower without telling me she was coming in, and i opened my eyes and almost had a heart attack. 


Kimber85     Sun Feb 4 23:02:00 2018 UTC

I wonder if  it&#39;s because of door to door solicitors and people proselytizing. If I don&#39;t know you&#39;re coming, I&#39;m hesitant to answer the door because I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s someone trying to sell me something. There&#39;s this guy trying to sell meat out of the back of his car that&#39;s come by every week for three weeks and I finally had to tell him I wasn&#39;t interested in buying meat from a random guy that I had no info on.
Same with the way I&#39;ve stopped answering any phone calls with numbers I don&#39;t know because of all the fucking scammers and telemarketers.


dycentra     Sun Feb 4 23:02:37 2018 UTC

Where and when I grew up, it was common for folks to just &quot;drop by&quot; unannounced.  I loved it.  No worries if you are in your pjs and the place is a mess.  They came to see you, not how your place looks.  Where I live now, people are invited and we have to spend hours cleaning the place to make it presentable.  I hate it.
I (F) met another F at a party back then.  We clicked as friends, and three days later, she raps on my door, walks in and says, &quot;Put the kettle on.&quot;  Forty years later, we are still BFFs. Although we live in different countries, we still see each other twice a year.  If she hadn&#39;t felt comfortable knocking on my door, would I ever had the bestest friend anyone could ever have?


HighRoLa_     Sun Feb 4 20:08:36 2018 UTC

My friend always does so, it pisses me off. 


Stuckin_Foned     Sun Feb 4 21:12:54 2018 UTC

Sometimes older relatives, friends, lost their phones/contacts.  


efr4n     Sun Feb 4 21:49:54 2018 UTC

structuredchronicles     Sun Feb 4 22:04:30 2018 UTC

For me, this is my biggest pet peeve. 


KittikatB     Sun Feb 4 22:10:41 2018 UTC

That&#39;s totally normal in my family and with my close friends.  I live in a different country to my family and my dad turned up unannounced once.


Reddit91210     Sun Feb 4 22:31:13 2018 UTC

I actually hate this. I showed up to a friends and he was pissed. I figure he’s not a real friend then. Any friend of mine shows up I invite them in, maybe I’m old school. 


ThatCrippledBastard     Sun Feb 4 22:43:08 2018 UTC

My next door neighbor shows up unannounced now and then and it&#39;s totally cool. I have known him for over a decade, so it stopped being weird a long time ago. Also he usually brings beer, so that helps. 


sarcasticmads     Sun Feb 4 22:52:33 2018 UTC

friends? what friends?? 


TyRoXx     Sun Feb 4 22:52:47 2018 UTC

If someone doesn&#39;t answer the door, they are probably taking a shower or out shopping or something.
If someone doesn&#39;t respond to a direct message within ten minutes, they must be dead or abducted.


Meredeen     Sun Feb 4 22:54:09 2018 UTC

I actually do this with my friend (we both still live at home with family).  After work/school I&#39;ll go over to his house and brush his cat, pet his dogs, and hang out with his mom for a bit.  They told me I don&#39;t even have to knock, I can just walk in, so I do.


Koogyz     Sun Feb 4 23:07:36 2018 UTC

Idk maybe it&#39;s just a different way of life but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird at all. I&#39;ve been doing this with my group of friends, and they with me, for like 10+ years. Our doors are always open for each other. As for my family, it&#39;s just an almost daily occurrence. We&#39;re just so used to the random drop ins that when it doesn&#39;t happen we think something&#39;s gone wrong. Well that&#39;s what my mother thinks at least. 


HardyBanardy     Sun Feb 4 23:19:05 2018 UTC

In the days when it was the social &quot;norm&quot;, it seemed people got along better and disconnected less. Now, people just want to text whatever they need, or gripe when it doesn&#39;t magically fall into their lap.


ilikepeopl     Sun Feb 4 23:20:02 2018 UTC

I HATE THAT. I <em>hate</em> when someone knocks on my door when I’m not expecting someone, 99% of the time it’s some religious nuts and the other 1% of the time I’m not ready and the house is messy. Fuck. That. Be a friend, send a text before showing up randomly.


dwb122     Sun Feb 4 23:22:27 2018 UTC

Unannounced visits for me: &quot;Welp, guess I gotta put on some pants&quot;


thothpethific92     Sun Feb 4 23:24:12 2018 UTC

I was literally just talking to someone how I fucking hate unannounced visitors now. It was cool until I was like 20. Especially if they were friends who I could go out with. Now basically the only person allowed to come over unannounced is my mom, and that never happens. Shoot me a text, get my consent and don&#39;t get butthurt when I tell you I&#39;m ready to end my day or night. Otherwise you won&#39;t be over again. 


slow_stroke     Mon Feb 5 01:07:31 2018 UTC

One of my friends would walk into our buddy&#39;s house, help himself to a bowl of cereal, then leave. Nobody would be home either, he would just send us all SC videos of his mad process. 


theviewfromhere9     Sun Feb 4 21:46:12 2018 UTC

I follow this etiquette 99% of the time. I only diverted from it when my kids were born. I have a lot of elderly neighbors and they were so happy when I showed up on their doorsteps with my newborn children. For an event like this being surprised is the way to go. After one of our visits my neighbour was so happy that my family and I were so comfortable arriving  unannounced (as is the tradition in his native India).


fakebutler     Sun Feb 4 20:24:50 2018 UTC

I cannot agree more. So, yesterday I go to my girlfriend&#39;s parents place just to give her a surprise. I mean I didn&#39;t enter the house, but was waiting in the nearby vicinity. She gets mad at me saying this is cheapest move I have ever seen till now, and I was like all I wanted was to give you a surprise, that&#39;s why the unannounced visit. But, apparently people prefer talking over whatsapp or fb than meeting in person. 
Social media is going to be the demise of 21st century.


Hingehead     Sun Feb 4 20:41:29 2018 UTC

It&#39;s going to turn into the matrix/ Bruce Willis&#39; &quot;The Surrogate&quot; type of society. It already has at this point. Everybody glued to their phones and tv 24/7. It&#39;s disgusting to be in a world of millions and yet feel so alone. 


mtothedubs     Sun Feb 4 20:59:32 2018 UTC

This is scary. Is it because people have to upkeep their persona that they portray online? 


HumaneSasquatch     Sun Feb 4 21:29:23 2018 UTC

No, it&#39;s because people will naturally take the easy route.  Why talk/associate in-person when you have a bit of anxiety when texts or facebook do the same thing?  Almost everyone has some form of anxiety, and it&#39;s amplified the less you tackle it, and keep it in check.
I think social media is a amazing example of how people and society can change, and how quickly it&#39;s unraveling centuries worth of social and societal cues.  So many people that would only have minor anxiety, or none at all, is now being unleashed because they don&#39;t get actual social practice.  And so many anxieties that were deemed unhealthy a generation ago, such as a fear of surprise human interaction are now considered &quot;normal&quot;.
Look how much it&#39;s changed in only 20 years, and without a huge society shift pointing out these problems and solving them, I&#39;m really scared what the next 20 years will bring.
My 2 cents based on my observations of society and myself growing throughout the information age.


mtothedubs     Sun Feb 4 21:34:36 2018 UTC

Very thought provoking. The snowball effect. If only they knew that if they all just rang their friends&#39; doorbells randomly once in a while we could be happier. Strengthening connections and letting people see their true selves all while having a good time (which is typically what happens when I hang with my best buddies)


Thorgrin1     Sun Feb 4 23:43:16 2018 UTC

Seeing this written makes the issue more tangible.
Often times I feel the divide in two dimensions between the virtual and the real. Seeing how the Instagram persona relates to a mundane person in the street, and the relation is not harmonic.
To me, IG is useful as I expand and contact people around the world (like here) but when I fall for a spree of local pretentious teen profiles, bleh. Feels unfair these have much more success (in metrics say likes) than interesting people that go unnoticed on the same platform... I think I do need a detox, exposure to its toxicity affects me.

Showing up at a family&#39;s house unannounced isn&#39;t weird. It&#39;s your own family...

🎼If I’d known you were coming, I’d’ve baked a cake.🎶


CleatusVandamn     Sun Feb 4 22:09:07 2018 UTC

I still do that. Some of my friends live in the same building as me or down the street and if I&#39;m walking by I might yell up to their apartment window or something.

Yeah, I don&#39;t even answer the door if I don&#39;t expect someone. Jehova&#39;s witnesses play a large part in that.


Wartrack     Sun Feb 4 22:24:58 2018 UTC

I try to encourage friends and family to show up unannounced - or at least come inside if I&#39;m already expecting them. No luck. 


TheNotoriousJTS     Sun Feb 4 22:31:17 2018 UTC

I actually have family up where its normal to just show up. And yeah, theyre super old school. Maine is basically if you combined the southeast USA ideologies with the politeness of canada


Lillani     Sun Feb 4 22:35:05 2018 UTC

When I was younger, neighbors and friends always walked into each others&#39; houses without knocking.
Where I live, it still happens all the time. Knocking is for strangers, not for friends and family.


Legiiii     Sun Feb 4 22:38:38 2018 UTC

That is so true. A week ago i wanted to visit a friend of me. I rang the bell on his door, no one was opening. He finally let me in after 10 mins and said „Why don‘t you just call me? I thought no one still rings the bell.“

maxence822     Sun Feb 4 23:49:11 2018 UTC

I live in a small-ish University town in Scotland and we do this all the time. It is really nice to be writing an essay or something and have some friends walk in and make you tea / join you and do a bit of work as well unanounced.


mr_bots     Sun Feb 4 23:56:12 2018 UTC

TIL me and my friends are weird. Not uncommon to just walk in as we generally have the codes to get into each other&#39;s garages.


mrcheese12345     Sun Feb 4 23:56:42 2018 UTC

I feel weird nowadays just calling a friend’s family home phone instead of their mobile when I can’t get hold of them


drchopsalot     Mon Feb 5 00:25:20 2018 UTC

I used to have friends that would do this. 


Hoosteen_juju003     Mon Feb 5 00:25:44 2018 UTC

I used to do this as a teen all the time. Or be like outside their house and text asking if we could hang out.


qigger     Mon Feb 5 00:42:15 2018 UTC

We had a knock on the door yesterday and just looked at each other and said I&#39;m not expecting anyone &quot;neither am I&quot; so we just ignored it. No one you want to come to your house shows up unannounced.


Smyra     Mon Feb 5 00:50:51 2018 UTC

I can&#39;t stand when people do that to me. But then again I do have a moderate case of social anxiety 🙈


octonus     Mon Feb 5 00:55:47 2018 UTC

Once, my roommate refused to let me into my own house because he wasn&#39;t expecting anyone.
My car was at the mechanic, which was walking distance away (3 miles). I didn&#39;t think about taking my house keys off my keyring, because I knew there would be someone at home. I get home, ring the doorbell, and watch the roommate not even glance towards the door from the couch. I try to call him, but my phone is dead.
Eventually, I ended up going over to my neighbors and borrowing their phone, just so i could call my roommate to let me in.


OMG_he     Mon Feb 5 00:59:39 2018 UTC

This just happened to me, a neighbor invited themselves over for the Super Bowl. :/


ChiknNoodl     Mon Feb 5 01:00:49 2018 UTC

Idk man raping small children is pretty weird but I see your point.


Spiderbanana     Mon Feb 5 01:04:33 2018 UTC

I have a friend who just comes by, sits on the couch while watching videos on his smartphone with the sound on (Yes, while we&#39;re trying to watch something else. If I&#39;m playing I don&#39;t mind).
Worst Part, he sometimes start screaming &quot;I&#39;m Hungry&quot; until we feed him ... Then he usually starts screaming that he wants wine.


mattym06     Mon Feb 5 01:11:51 2018 UTC

Fuck that bro. The prick that didn’t invite me, wanted me...


orangeguy99     Mon Feb 5 01:17:23 2018 UTC

I find this weird. I live in a relatively small-ish town. It was never like this for me. Ill also point out that there&#39;s a fair amount of the elderly. There&#39;s no sidewalks so its dangerous to walk across town and I had only one friend who lived within a safe distance. And even then, the only time I turned up unanounced was because I was riding my bike and <em>really</em> needed a glass of water. Because of this, most visits were expected because you had to drive or be driven. Maybe its a regional or generational thing; My mom&#39;s done it with her friends but she&#39;s probably the most sociable person in the family. Maybe it&#39;s because I hate inviting myself to other people&#39;s homes
I don&#39;t like the concept of the pop-in. If I&#39;m expecting someone I&#39;m at least gonna take some time to tidy up the house and/or shower if I need to. Unless there&#39;s an emergency or you&#39;re just dropping by to return something you borrowed, I think its kinda rude. Even just a simple &quot;can I come over&quot; text is good.

There was a load of us would meet for drinks Fri-Sun at a mates house. Any time I went around there, I&#39;d do the obvious thing &amp; knock, even after I&#39;d known her for <em>years</em>.
She&#39;d often say &quot;When you come around, just let yourself in&quot; but to me, that&#39;s just wrong. Perhaps if announced I was en route, but even then I&#39;d feel so wrong just walking into someone else&#39;s place.
