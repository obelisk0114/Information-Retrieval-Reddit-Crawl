<em>person across the street laughs to their phone</em>: &quot;they&#39;re totally laughing at me. I knew I shouldn&#39;t have bought this outfit. I wanna go home and burn it.&quot;


VuxTheMighty     Sun Feb 4 00:56:33 2018 UTC

Same for me. Just not the outfit, but the way i walk


Senjoi     Sun Feb 4 01:05:31 2018 UTC

There is nothing worse than thinking about the way you walk while walking. What do I do with my arms? Am I walking too fast? Am I standing up straight? I hate anxiety


SapientMonkey     Sun Feb 4 02:14:34 2018 UTC

When someone is walking behind me i go from automatic to manual mode...
<em>walking normally</em> -&gt; some is behind me -&gt; <em>left leg, right arm, am I going too fast, right leg, left arm, blink blink</em>


ArcherInPosition     Sun Feb 4 01:16:18 2018 UTC

Ah Christ now this is gonna be on my mind the next I walk. Like manually breathing and blinking my eyes. 


albertttz     Sun Feb 4 01:19:28 2018 UTC

Why did you have to say manually blinking! Ugh..


fluffenstein     Sun Feb 4 02:35:36 2018 UTC

Have you ever thought about how your tongue doesn&#39;t really fit in your mouth?


ABaadPun     Sun Feb 4 03:02:13 2018 UTC

As a linguist i can verify that it&#39;s supposed to do that, so you make the mouth sound different.

Jns112     Sun Feb 4 04:06:35 2018 UTC

Oh, and don&#39;t forget that at least one spot on your body is at least slightly itchy at all times.

Squishthefishyouwish     Sun Feb 4 05:56:48 2018 UTC

Ever think about how your eyelids are always touching your eyes and it doesn‚Äôt bother you one bit? 


Rocklandband     Sun Feb 4 03:59:18 2018 UTC

Also one of your nostrils is always harder to breathe through than the other.


ShapesAndStuff     Sun Feb 4 02:46:53 2018 UTC

&quot;fun&quot; fact: facial palsy makes my right eye not shut fully when blinking so every now and then i have to actually <em>manually</em> blink with my hand.
Super fun. 


MeatyChunks     Sun Feb 4 04:10:03 2018 UTC

Have you looked into getting a weight inserted in your eyelid? I believe that was a thing for Bell&#39;s Palsy when I looked it up.


badassvikingAMA     Sun Feb 4 04:40:06 2018 UTC

Imagine being stoned with weights in your eyelids 


thewolfisme     Sun Feb 4 04:11:45 2018 UTC

Yeah, now I&#39;m blinking weird 


SwiftbutnotTaylor     Sun Feb 4 01:57:22 2018 UTC

As i walk, i think to myself &quot;heel toe, or toe heel?&quot; fuck, now both ways of walking feel awkward.

Am I walking too loud? Is my bag making a lot of noise? Can people listen to what I&#39;m listening to because my earphones are crappy? Better pause my music and listen. Oh God everything is so loud damn these stupid shoes and the things in my bag oh God they&#39;re laughing at me better walk faster just a few more steps till I get home oh God it&#39;s louder when I go faster better walk slower but fuck I can hear them laughing they&#39;re laughing at me god fucking dammit

It&#39;s nice when people up vote you, but when you get down voted and/or there&#39;s a reply, its a nightmare. I usually can&#39;t open the message notification. So sorry you may experience this just now, but when it&#39;s a nice comment, all is well. This is an intended nice comment of camaraderie. I feel you. 


spotplay     Sun Feb 4 09:18:30 2018 UTC

I relate so much to all this. Please just don&#39;t respond.


novachaos     Sun Feb 4 02:48:43 2018 UTC

My arms are sticking out too much while I walk, aren‚Äôt they. 
Yep, they sure are and everyone is wondering why you‚Äôre walking like a weird duck. 


gurg2k1     Sun Feb 4 03:34:51 2018 UTC

Or when you happen to be in a place with music playing, &quot;don&#39;t walk to the beat. Do NOT walk to the beat.&quot; and then you wind up walking to the beat, feeling like an idiot.

unguardedsnow     Sun Feb 4 01:10:54 2018 UTC

What about waling, but theres music playing, and your walk just happens to be the same place as the song so you think people are like, wow, that guy likes that song. 


carpetbowl     Sun Feb 4 01:48:44 2018 UTC

Oh god. I got called out for walking without swinging my arms. But the same girl redeemed herself when she shouted, ‚ÄúMOVE YOUR SKINNY ASS‚Äù at me. I had grown several inches taller the year leading up to this, but since my weight had stayed the same I still thought I was husky.
Also, fuck pants companies that use the word ‚Äúhusky‚Äù as a size.


LigniteCA     Sun Feb 4 01:11:07 2018 UTC

Now add that to a disability which makes you actually walk weird and you have my life


happy_sleepy     Sun Feb 4 01:18:26 2018 UTC

Now put that in work setting. It can lead to weird shit. 


the_bananafish     Sun Feb 4 01:58:13 2018 UTC

Work is the worst. They‚Äôre obviously laughing at me because they all got together and decided that the food I eat for lunch and the time of day that I go to the restroom is weird and they heard me say hello to the receptionist and I coughed right after to clear my throat and they thought I was being a bitch so now they all hate me. 


tryingmyhardest88     Sun Feb 4 02:00:59 2018 UTC

But at the same time you just know all of this is in your head. But there are times when you wonder &quot;there&#39;s no smoke without fire&quot; and then you take that shit home and overthink it till you&#39;re exhausted and fall asleep. Then a new day begins, but all that over thinking must have formed some neural pathway pattern in your head right? So that leads to something else the next day. How long can you continue like this? Oh shit.

GodKingofEarth     Sun Feb 4 01:32:43 2018 UTC

Absolutely. I dress in a small collection of very similar outfits, not necessarily because they look good (they&#39;re alright), but because I&#39;m too afraid people will judge me if I do something different.


maddtuck     Sun Feb 4 03:49:35 2018 UTC

Yes. I freaked out once when I wore new shoes and a woman immediately said, ‚Äúnew shoes?‚Äù  Like do people look at my feet every day and remember what shoes I‚Äôm usually wearing?


hcast     Sun Feb 4 04:28:58 2018 UTC

I remember throwing together an outfit one morning with a hat to cover my shitty self-done haircut. Then I walked outside realizing it was Monday morning and I began to think my outfit seemed to look too nice for a Monday morning. Not only that, but I was wearing almost all black and I was afraid people were thinking I looked way too edgy. The coat I was wearing was also a raincoat and I was scared people were judging me for wearing it while it wasn‚Äôt even raining. Moreover, my hat was a snapback with a bill that I messily tried to curve because I was scared people would judge me for wearing a flat-billed snapback. The entire day, I was just screaming in my head, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me, don‚Äôt look at me, don‚Äôt look at me, etc‚Äù until I returned to the dorm.
Shit sucks. I hate having any attention while I‚Äôm outside wherever home is and prefer reveling in total anonymity. On the other hand, I also pay way too much attention in my appearance for someone who prefers to not have any eyes on him. Hell, I‚Äôm even writing this post thinking it‚Äôs way too long and people are judging me for it.<h1>BUT FUCK IT</h1>


jackasseress     Sun Feb 4 07:22:04 2018 UTC

Aww. You&#39;re doin great! Sounds like a cute outfit. Literally can never go wrong with all black.


buttersauce     Sun Feb 4 01:41:11 2018 UTC

wow thats so me.  It takes me at least a month of owning new glasses or clothing before I&#39;m able to wear it in public.  I can&#39;t stand the thought of people thinking I&#39;m trying too hard or not hard enough.

Glad to know I&#39;m not the only one. Or you walk into a room and people are having a conversation and they laugh, &quot;they&#39;re all laughing at me!&quot;... I hate it.

Oh, wait. We&#39;re talking about anxiety. Anxiety already wires your body full of nervous tension, so yeah. Tacking a stimulant onto that probably ain&#39;t the best of ideas.
You know what kinda sucks? Having depression and social anxiety disorder at the same time. Like, what the fuck do you even take for that? Weed laced with meth? Meth cut with weed?

Why are they being too nice? Who is paying them? What do they want?

Are they making fun of me in a sarcastic way? 


icanhazagoodtime     Sun Feb 4 01:55:52 2018 UTC

A friend recently complimented me on my hair, and my immediate response was &quot;why, they standing up wierd or something?&quot;

This shit is too real
everyone is in on it


HELLOALSOYES     Sun Feb 4 09:02:47 2018 UTC

Pretty sure all of my friends are just playing the long game and will only punish me appropriately once I have finally submitted to this realisation.


Shippoyasha     Sun Feb 4 05:29:10 2018 UTC

The sad thing is that I know for a certain a few people do that, because I&#39;ve caught them backtalking about me. Doesn&#39;t help my already severe social anxiety

&quot;They just want validation so they&#39;re complimenting me on stupid stuff so I will too&quot;
or
&quot;They just don&#39;t want to be mean because that would make them feel bad so they&#39;re finding literally anything not horrible about me to talk about&quot;
or
&quot;They&#39;re just morons who don&#39;t understand I didn&#39;t even try to make that look good, fuck I need friends who aren&#39;t okay with mediocrity&quot;

Catalonia1936     Sun Feb 4 04:32:21 2018 UTC

I just talk at/towards people and interpret everything they say literally. I never really pick up on stuff like that.


Moses_The_Wise     Sun Feb 4 03:14:23 2018 UTC

They probably hate me and are just pretending to like me so they can insult me later and reveal they were never really my friends 


ahalfdozen6     Sun Feb 4 03:58:32 2018 UTC

I have a very similar issue with my husband. He‚Äôs absolutely besotted with me. He loves me, misses me when I‚Äôm away, wants to just spend time with me. And I just cannot work out why. What‚Äôs in it for him. I feel the same way towards him but unfortunately my warped brain can‚Äôt properly liken how I feel about him, to how he feels about me. 
Of course I love him, he‚Äôs great and loveable and basically I ‚Äújust do‚Äù. But why would he love me? 
Hooray self confidence.

OGmapletits     Sun Feb 4 08:13:20 2018 UTC

This is EXACTLY how I feel! I know he loves me soooo much and I&#39;m always saying why are you bothering with me? He says  that if I had even a fifth of the self esteem I should have he would have never had a chance. Still don&#39;t see it. Yay self depreciation?! 


ahalfdozen6     Sun Feb 4 08:16:49 2018 UTC

Yep, my husband says to me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of glad your self esteem is so low. If it were higher, you‚Äôd see you‚Äôre too good for me‚Äù. He‚Äôs mucking around but I just really don‚Äôt understand that at all. 


ResistencePlea     Sun Feb 4 01:00:14 2018 UTC

When I get complimented it‚Äôs immediately assumed it was sarcastic and they‚Äôre making fun of me.


Acceptable67     Sun Feb 4 01:25:46 2018 UTC

I agree, I feel that most compliments directed towards my way are just people being fake and trying to make me feel good, even with evidence to the contrary.

Already there


rolipolioliveoil     Sun Feb 4 01:16:29 2018 UTC

Same here. And then when I ask myself why they&#39;re my friends I think it must be because they pity me. 


immallama     Sun Feb 4 04:02:24 2018 UTC

For me its &quot;they don&#39;t really want to be your friend but they&#39;re just too nice to tell you anymore and they&#39;re kinda stuck with you&quot;


TheProofIsInTheSmile     Sun Feb 4 04:39:48 2018 UTC

The problem is also in having friends you feel that way about sometimes, so then you have to decide if you&#39;re just salty / having a bad day / having (teenage) mood swings, or you actually need to get away.


Althea6302     Sun Feb 4 05:13:29 2018 UTC

So you ghost because you want to be alone and later miss them and wish you could spend time with them again. Self sabotage is great! /s


PokeWaffles42     Sun Feb 4 01:39:42 2018 UTC

Same but then I always try (and fail) to repay them so it&#39;s like<blockquote>
FRIEND: I like your shirt!
ME: haha thanks [awkward pause] yours is cool too


Polibate     Sun Feb 4 03:57:18 2018 UTC

Ah, I dread those moments. Those awkward pauses are just us socially anxious people overthinking the whole situation like, &quot;What does he really mean by &quot;I like your shirt?&quot; &quot;

I have thought this for a year at my job. I seem to get a huge amount of praise and everyone acts like they like me. I always put it of to being the new guy but I think I might actually be good at my job. This scares me, a lot. 


Oovenlah     Sun Feb 4 04:15:51 2018 UTC

I once worked for a very successful gentleman with whom I got along very well. 
He once told me that I needed to learn to take a compliment. I had a &quot;bad habit of modest self deprication&quot; (his words)  and that I needed to quit it because it was rude to the complimenter and useless to me. He said, &quot;when somone pays you a compliment, you say &#39;thank you&#39; and move on.&quot;
I have followed that advice ever since then and it has served me well.

I used to tell my grandma she was biased.


Gius9811     Sun Feb 4 02:07:32 2018 UTC

My &quot;social anxiety&quot; (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right term), works in a weird way. I feel confident when talking with people, but right after the conversation ends I think about everything I said and I feel stupid for it.
For example:<blockquote>
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re wearing collants and it&#39;s freezing, you&#39;re crazy!&quot;
&quot;Ahah, I&#39;m fine&quot;
After a minute or two I wonder how inappropiate have I been, how I might have been rude...
I know it&#39;s all in my head, but sometimes I feel bad nonetheless. I think I needed to share this.


havejubilation     Sun Feb 4 02:31:40 2018 UTC

I feel this so hard. I can be spontaneous and kind of talkative, and then I have such remorse about everything I&#39;ve ever said. People seem to enjoy me, but I often wish I could just put the brakes on in the moment and say nothing at all. 


poisonousautumn     Sun Feb 4 04:11:35 2018 UTC

This is also me in a nutshell.  Sometimes it kicks in days later, though.  I&#39;ll have like spontaneously analytical episodes.


havejubilation     Sun Feb 4 04:30:14 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve actually had analytical episodes kick in <em>years</em> later. It&#39;s exhausting, yo. 


poisonousautumn     Sun Feb 4 04:34:09 2018 UTC

Holllly shit same here.  Feels like just too much.  Shit from when you are a kid and you don&#39;t even have the same mental framework to analyze it properly.  it&#39;s like social ptsd at that point.


wadaphunk     Sun Feb 4 08:18:14 2018 UTC

Hey guys, I used to be you. I&#39;ve found a cure to this, and you&#39;ve probably heard of it already. Meditation. What meditation ultimately does is allowing you to put a space between you and your thoughts. You are not your thoughts. After a time, you will be able to catch yourself been a thought like this arises and just switch your thought pattern to something else. Good luck, friends.


TheWhiteAlbatross     Sun Feb 4 06:35:22 2018 UTC

Okay, too real. 


MasterChiefGuy5     Sun Feb 4 04:36:28 2018 UTC

Having brunch with my in laws tomorrow and for the past few days I‚Äôve been telling myself ‚ÄúOnly respond, don‚Äôt speak.‚Äù My anxiety is so bad around them after 15 years I‚Äôve reduced myself to just sitting and nodding. 


amerioali     Sun Feb 4 04:04:03 2018 UTC

I feel this comment is best to put something that&#39;s been on my mind.
So I was at work and a few employees were giving my manager a hard time. So he goes to me and he&#39;s like &quot;amerioali, why don&#39;t people like me&quot;(in a shorta joking way). And I simply said &quot;Yeah man (he&#39;s pretty young), I don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re way more leaner than some of the other bosses so idk&quot;.
What I wanted to say to him was &quot;Honestly I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that people don&#39;t like you. You&#39;re a boss figure and generally people don&#39;t like being told what to do(warehouse job, a lot of people are lazy af). I wouldn&#39;t take it personal.&quot;
I feel like my first instinctive response was sorta rude and I just can&#39;t get over it


maero5e     Sun Feb 4 03:50:14 2018 UTC

You&#39;re not alone. I stress exactly like this on the daily. 


NoCares00     Sun Feb 4 04:08:47 2018 UTC

I&#39;m terrible about this. I can recall exactly what I said/did and why I feel stupid or stressed about it a decade later. Funny how embarrassment burns into your head like that.


TheWhiteAlbatross     Sun Feb 4 06:39:00 2018 UTC

So it never gets better huh? Great.


Kikekakako     Sun Feb 4 07:02:30 2018 UTC

I think the best way to work on this is just too think about how you feel when someone does/says the same thing to you... You usually don&#39;t care, so why would they??? 
This really helped my social anxiety when it came to learning a second language...I would feel so stupid and annoying, and would try not to talk, or would analyze everything I said... but then I would just remember how I feel when someone learning English speaks to me...I&#39;m patient, I try to understand, I don&#39;t care if they make mistakes etc. If someone is bothered, or makes a big deal out of it, they&#39;re probably a dick, so fuck &#39;em


shaurcasm     Sun Feb 4 05:37:43 2018 UTC

That happens to me too! I think there are two kinds of (broadly) anxieties, post-action anxiety and pre-action anxiety 


ontheonesandtwos     Sun Feb 4 04:29:58 2018 UTC

Sam, but I feel said convo as a stepping stone to overcoming social anxiety. Many people who suffer wouldn‚Äôt bother having a conversation. BABY STEPS


alter-eagle     Sun Feb 4 06:44:51 2018 UTC

Can relate. The thing that keeps me going is knowing that other ‚Äúconfident‚Äù people make the same kind of mistakes, but just seem to move on. I just emulate that, even though it‚Äôs running through my head, because it‚Äôs probably running through that ‚Äúconfident‚Äù person‚Äôs head the rest of the day as well. 
Keep on keepin, fellow awkward human! We‚Äôre all in this together!


Flashwubba     Sun Feb 4 02:40:38 2018 UTC

Yesss!!! This is me!


nekmint     Sat Feb 3 22:38:30 2018 UTC

i find my social anxiety goes away when drunk, super tired, sick, or when deep in thought about a topic that i enjoy talking about. might sound over the top but in those moments i feel a lightness and freedom that isn&#39;t there even when i&#39;m alone in my room. anxiety is like a bloatware that runs in the background slowing everything down and occasionally crashing the whole system. 


howtohidefromfriends     Sat Feb 3 22:46:13 2018 UTC

I couldn&#39;t agree more with you.


newsposts     Sun Feb 4 00:33:21 2018 UTC

This is it. Social anxiety is having no sense of purpose. When you find a sense of purpose, you cant be socially anxious. When you&#39;re sick, you have a purpose to get better, so you&#39;re not worried about petty shit etc etc. we did it reddit we solved social anxiety. 
Omg is this comment gonna get upvoted or downvoted, im freaking the fuck out. 


NotAnArtHoe666     Sun Feb 4 00:58:19 2018 UTC

Actually you might be onto something there; studies show that animals experience much higher rates of anxiety when they&#39;ve been removed from the wild and just surviving is no longer a primary concern, which might seem counterintuitive as all threats have been eliminated. 


Polkemon9     Sun Feb 4 01:54:28 2018 UTC

That got me thinking, Nietzsche said ‚ÄúTo live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.‚Äù So without having to survive, perhaps we(or animals) have an innate need to find a goal to avoid suffering, and anxiety is the manifestation of that. But I‚Äôm no philosopher, just a random thought


actual_llama     Sun Feb 4 02:03:24 2018 UTC

No, I agree with this statement. 
It&#39;s also crossed my mind that mental illness is the manifestation of humanity&#39;s progress toward dissipating physical illness. Seemingly, the fewer people there are who suffer from measles, malaria, and cancer, the more people suffer from bipolar, anxiety, and psychosis. Also a random thought :)


ConformistSheep98     Sun Feb 4 02:46:42 2018 UTC

I always figured that mental illness was something we just white-knuckled our way through for however many thousands of years until scientists were able to identify/treat it


actual_llama     Sun Feb 4 04:20:15 2018 UTC

Before the late 19th/early 20th century, people either fought through it, were ostracized (and likely died), or were embraced by their culture. My humanities professor in college talked about how schizophrenics had a place in Russia (I believe much less common), living in churches and being some kind of voice or in special communion with God.
People didn&#39;t much care about homosexuality or other bedroom stuff until society started thriving and people started to define what is normal. Before the study of sexuality, nobody gave a fuck.


youguyyou     Sun Feb 4 04:33:15 2018 UTC

Yea I think this all the time about all those dudes coming back from war fucked up but undiagnosed. But on the other hand maybe facing your mental illnesses out of necessity can turn them from mountains to molehills. A safe and relatively complacent modern life often leaves people with only internal issues to sort out, which maybe allows people to attack those issues the same way you would poverty, survival, illness etc which just exacerbates them in the end because they aren‚Äôt really scary problems but just your thoughts n shit you know?? Idk


uhohuhohuhohuhohuh     Sun Feb 4 04:44:30 2018 UTC

Absolutely...I don&#39;t know why I find the above comment really offensive, I probably shouldn&#39;t. But the way people described mental illness in history was probably with terms like &#39;prophet, witch, seer etc&#39; or maybe just in deep need of an exorcism. 
I&#39;m bipolar and have thought a lot about it. I think our unhealthy lives has certainly caused an increase in mental illness, just as it has with every other illness.


Polkemon9     Sun Feb 4 02:10:28 2018 UTC

Interesting. I wonder how those correlate. Maybe our subconscious knows all these things that aren‚Äôt obvious to us and are doing stuff behind the scenes to help us. I wish I knew what I‚Äôm talking about lol, but I doubt I‚Äôd see the day where consciousness can be explained. 


The_Grubby_One     Sun Feb 4 03:31:35 2018 UTC

I&#39;m fairly sure antisocial personality disorder isn&#39;t particularly helpful. And I <em>know</em> depression and social anxiety aren&#39;t.


andallforwantofwit     Sun Feb 4 04:15:25 2018 UTC

Well, i&#39;mma pause my anxiety about how this will be perceived but sometimes I consider the possibility that depression exists when one has no meaning, and doesn&#39;t contribute to society and when they kill themselves it serves the purpose of removing the burden of their care from the contributing members.


slaf19     Sun Feb 4 03:16:35 2018 UTC

I feel like a major reason might just be because people are living longer.


actual_llama     Sun Feb 4 04:24:13 2018 UTC

But that shouldn&#39;t affect the prevalence rate though. Some are born with mental illness, others develop it as kids, adults, or most commonly between 17-23. Since life expectancy for humans hasn&#39;t been low 20s for a very long time, there has to be something to it.
It could very well just be that it was the same but historians lack the documentation to come to that conclusion. Who knows.


abc159713     Sun Feb 4 04:54:28 2018 UTC

That&#39;s because we haven&#39;t been diagnosing mental disorders for very long... You think we knew what an anxiety disorder was in the 1600&#39;s; we blamed abnormalities in personality on witchcraft.  We are just getting better at categorizing and diagnosing these disorders.  


youguyyou     Sun Feb 4 04:28:19 2018 UTC

I fucking love this thread lol. Like all my thoughts except more fully formed and articulated much better by the internet. Who needs therapy guys? Just use Reddit more often


mrspoopy_butthole     Sun Feb 4 04:25:25 2018 UTC

That fits so well with this thread but why do we feel so much anxiety when our body goes into ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù with adrenaline etc.


NotAnArtHoe666     Sun Feb 4 02:11:58 2018 UTC

That&#39;s an excellent point! Anxiety is a natural response to threat and is completely necessary in a life or death situation. However, an anxiety disorder occurs when the brain perceives &quot;threats&quot; where they don&#39;t exist. Perhaps the brain is aware that it needs to provoke an anxious fight or flight response (suffering), yet lacks appropriate environmental stimulus and thus overcompensates.


liberty5651     Sun Feb 4 02:00:00 2018 UTC

Is it not nice that we live in a technologically superior over-productive society that give us ample free time to spend developing our own conspiratorial isolation bubbles?


NotAnArtHoe666     Sun Feb 4 02:23:00 2018 UTC

Funny that no matter how far we&#39;ve come as a species, we can&#39;t seem to relieve our innate ennui. Perhaps that&#39;s what&#39;s driven us to achieve all that we have. It&#39;s a sobering thought lol, that part of our humanity might be rooted in an insatiable thirst for contentment 


liberty5651     Sun Feb 4 02:29:26 2018 UTC

Yeah, that is true.  Can you imagine sitting still all day?  Even in the winter with a short eight hour day you can&#39;t sit still that whole time, unless you&#39;re like The Mahatma or something.  And then we have to give some direction to the nerves that get us up and moving around.

faceplanted     Sun Feb 4 04:07:15 2018 UTC

Being removed from the wild is probably a stressful experience however you do it though, either you get tranquillised and wake up in an enclosed space with these weird human things constantly trying to interact with you, or you get trapped and then taken away in a strange vehicle and never see your family again.
Chances are if you&#39;re taken to somewhere like a zoo or something you surrounded by the smells of other animals you don&#39;t want to go anywhere near, either because of predation or territoriality.
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong, but I don&#39;t think even if what you say is true, and we&#39;ve culturally held wildly incorrect ideas about nature based on animals in captivity before (See: wolves and the &quot;alpha&quot; concept, which isn&#39;t how wolves actually work, and definitely not how humans work), then I doubt that you could reasonably apply that blanket ideas to human psychology.


Schmidtz     Sun Feb 4 00:45:13 2018 UTC

Your anxiety is your projection of a lack of purpose, in your case, I have friends who have social anxiety but for different reasons, it all manifests itself differently but falls under the same umbrella of anxiety disorders...
And YES, it can be overcome for most people suffering from it. Exposure therapy is one way to go, easier said than done, don&#39;t get me wrong

I solved my anxiety by making it my purpose to befriend people‚Äôs pets at parties. I now have more pet friends than human friends.


shorun     Sun Feb 4 01:12:22 2018 UTC

pets are the best friends.
it always breaks me when an owner dies and i cant take in the cat due to overcrowding.


itscoolguy     Sun Feb 4 05:29:58 2018 UTC

You sound like this happens a lot. Are you... urdering the owners?


shorun     Sun Feb 4 07:02:01 2018 UTC

do you have a cat?


Schmidtz     Sun Feb 4 01:03:39 2018 UTC

That&#39;s cool, any way that works for you is a good way (assuming it isn&#39;t at the expense of others). Step by step, you can overcome the haunting and daunting social anxiety by means which you gain more control over your own thoughts as much as possible.
I don&#39;t even have social anxiety, I don&#39;t have that many friends either and that&#39;s OK too, it&#39;s the fulfillment factor (whatever that may be) which is important to be fulfilled in the end.

Exposure therapy is one way to go, easier said than done, don&#39;t get me wrong
This is what did it for me.  I got over my social anxiety by putting myself in uncomfortable situations.  
One thing that helped me was to remind myself that <em>none of the people here know me.</em>  That meant I could be whoever I wanted to be.
I&#39;m sure almost everybody has heard the saying, &quot;fake it til you make it.&quot;
That&#39;s what worked for me.
And, yes, easier said than done.


MisterNiceGuy001     Sun Feb 4 07:56:11 2018 UTC

It can work in certain situations but a lot of social anxiety is triggered for me with people I <em>do</em> know. I hate going to Walmart in my town because it&#39;s usually a high school reunion and when I get nervous I get all red and sweaty which I can feel or see the other person reacting to which intensifies it greatly. I&#39;ve learned to just go in with honest positive thoughts. I&#39;ve also worked on bettering myself in honest ways so when I tell myself I&#39;m a good person I can mean it. Preparing rebuttals and talking points for conversions with people has been a big help. I feel like all the cliche conversation banter I hated before has helped me in steering myself in and out of conversations. I remind myself about times I&#39;ve had run ins with old friends and they get nervous like me and it helps me selfishly feel I&#39;m not alone, and that we&#39;re all just humans going about our lives. People can be weird but it ultimately doesn&#39;t change my opinion of who they are, majority of people feel the same too so don&#39;t sweat it too much.


TheMeddlingMonk8     Sun Feb 4 07:27:33 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve been doing this, and I think I&#39;ve been making progress. Most recently, I have been organising a few events with people that I met late last year, so that I can get to know them better.


NighthawkOE3D     Sun Feb 4 02:07:45 2018 UTC

Once shy and anxious person here who only had to make the moment awkward 10000 times before becoming OK with myself. I.e. Exposure therapy. It&#39;s funny because when you are confident people think it&#39;s easy but really it&#39;s just you embarrassed yourself 100x more than others would. 


Alpha_AF     Sun Feb 4 02:02:40 2018 UTC

I essentially put myself in exposure therapy. Not necessarily on purpose, but it worked. Most people would never I suffer from it, or how bad it was for awhile.


mulierbona     Sun Feb 4 05:23:31 2018 UTC

Exposure (to social situations) doesn‚Äôt seem to help me unless I‚Äôm the one setting up the situation, knowing what‚Äôs going on before I enter it, and then entering and leaving on my own. 
Otherwise - I‚Äôm anxious/irritated/annoyed/scared/on edge/you name it.

Nakoichi     Sun Feb 4 00:53:53 2018 UTC

Sympathy upvotes for all! But seriously I relate to <a href="/u/nekmint">u/nekmint</a> here. I am at my best when I am at work (lead cashier at a locally beloved grocery store) I can be really charismatic when I know my job depends on it or with enough of the good ol&#39; liquid  courage but otherwise am self conscious and awkward as hell.


SteamedUpJoe     Sun Feb 4 01:23:41 2018 UTC

This must be why I feel like my impending doom is coming when I&#39;m gaming alone late at night.  
I can&#39;t even enjoy a beer at times because it only amplifies the anxiety.


Crymsonbutterfly     Sun Feb 4 00:52:24 2018 UTC

reddit is forever in your.debt.


cuculhiann     Sun Feb 4 01:23:57 2018 UTC

I recently got promoted to a position of management and I&#39;m running around all day and constantly in conflict. I find I don&#39;t have as bad of anxiety at work but when I&#39;m home after it gets intense thinking about all the bullshit and conflicts, so this makes sense to me.


thecanadiangoose     Sun Feb 4 01:38:22 2018 UTC

Anxiety in general worrying about the future/things that may or may not happen in the future. What helps the most (For me) is keeping a level head and trying to improve self-confidence. Hope that helps a bit aha


cornstub     Sun Feb 4 01:45:36 2018 UTC

tfw Reddit has more effectively psychoanalyzed you than your therapist has, and yet you still have no solution and know that you&#39;re going to sleep in until 3PM tomorrow, lay in bed until 7, eat junk food, then go back to sleep.


EdBegleysMindScooter     Sun Feb 4 01:56:01 2018 UTC

EdanE33     Sun Feb 4 00:26:03 2018 UTC

I have a friend who really struggles until we start taking about gaming, and then it&#39;s like he&#39;s never been socially anxious, it&#39;s nice to see.


AllAboutLove     Sun Feb 4 03:57:56 2018 UTC

Gaming is wonderful for my (I&#39;ll call it minor) social anxiety.  It&#39;s a medium that everyone can focus on that provides it&#39;s own conversation generation.  It keeps my brain occupied and in a healthy flow of thought while simultaneously allowing opportunities for &quot;normal&quot; conversation to occur as well.  


Keretor     Sun Feb 4 06:45:51 2018 UTC

Everytime I get to talk to someone about something that I love (say, the lore of a game/show) I feel fucking amazing


Paltenburg     Sun Feb 4 16:34:26 2018 UTC

Yeah
Why can&#39;t gaming and tv-shows be as popular as like sports.


plantedtoast     Sun Feb 4 00:41:49 2018 UTC

I get suicidal when I&#39;m too tired or sick. But after a stiff drink or two, I just feel... Free. I can sit quietly and not be hyper vigilant. I&#39;m not analyzing anything I just said. I&#39;m not holding my body just right to try and seem normal. I&#39;m not panicking about medical issues or thinking in circles about something trivial.
Its hard not to self medicate with alcohol. It&#39;s the easy route compared to therapy (which doesn&#39;t work for me so far, plus I&#39;m terrified of the visits) or the shit that happens with medication. Just a quiet night once a week or so after a good drink.
Just can&#39;t drink when I&#39;m already upset. That&#39;s a recipe for a shitty, shitty time. 


pippyLONGsocking     Sun Feb 4 01:25:46 2018 UTC

I wish that were the case for me. I&#39;m definitely freer when I drink, but there&#39;s always this part of me that&#39;s super aware of everything I&#39;m doing that tells me I&#39;m a drunk idiot who&#39;s bumming out my friends, even when they&#39;re having a good time. Then, the next day I wake up and regret getting drunk in the first place, because it&#39;s the only time I&#39;m really out of m shell and I find it embarrassing.
Weed on the other hand, makes me super chill and really not care, but I don&#39;t smoke it anymore.


RelevantMetaUsername     Sun Feb 4 01:31:40 2018 UTC

Damn, I&#39;m the other way around with weed. If I&#39;m alone or with close friends I&#39;m fine, but at a party or social gathering I get hyper-aware of my body and start over analyzing everything I say.
Alcohol makes me depressed if I&#39;m in a bad mood when I drink it, but it destroys my anxiety.


SoRealSurreal     Sun Feb 4 01:58:50 2018 UTC

Same man.  If I‚Äôm high and in a room with more than - probably literally - one person I don‚Äôt know well, I get crazy social anxiety.
I really wish I enjoyed alcohol more than I do.  It seems like it would actually be really good for me to learn how to come out of my shell a little through the use of mind-altering substances.


Vaqmed     Sun Feb 4 02:34:49 2018 UTC

whats so bad with alcohol in my experience is that u always feel shit the day after, not just the hangover. its basically a trade off that always end with 0 outcome, either i have 100% anxiety friday and saturday, or i party friday, 0% anxiety but the day after i have 200% thinking of all the shit i did


AllAboutLove     Sun Feb 4 03:52:13 2018 UTC

Drinking is borrowing happiness from tomorrow.


havefaiiithinme     Sun Feb 4 01:47:49 2018 UTC

I was going to say, weed! When I smoke weed the constant stress/wheel of thoughts running in the back of my mind truly doesn&#39;t exist, I freely move with 0 regrets the next day. I really like to interact and connect with others in my world when I&#39;m high and it comes so easily. It also helps me articulate my thoughts and see the importance in love and connecting.


Dammit_Jessie     Sun Feb 4 01:56:59 2018 UTC

Weed makes me super anxious and aware of my own mortality.  I wish it did for me what it does for people that like it.  It sounds almost like xanax but not horrible for you.


saythereshope     Sun Feb 4 01:21:51 2018 UTC

If your hyper vigilance is born from ptsd (even abuse from childhood), try EMDR. Did more for me in six sessions than talk therapy ever did.


plantedtoast     Sun Feb 4 05:33:40 2018 UTC

That&#39;s exactly what it is. PTSD from child abuse and anxiety stemming from similar + strong family history. I have a trained dog just to feel safe in my own home.
Thank you. This small comment has breathed a lot of life into my day. I&#39;ll look into who offers it in my area. 


saythereshope     Sun Feb 4 05:36:32 2018 UTC

Read ‚Äòthe body keeps the score‚Äô. It‚Äôs a great book that goes through all of the latest research on childhood ptsd and what the best regimen is. It is totally beatable.

ELI5 please?


saythereshope     Sun Feb 4 14:37:01 2018 UTC

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
You know how REM sleep allows us to process memories while we&#39;re sleeping? There&#39;s a theory of PTSD and memory that trauma makes it difficult for the brain to properly process memory so trauma gets &#39;stuck&#39; in the brain. 
EMDR is like REM sleep while you&#39;re awake. They use alternating stimulating pulses (my therapist uses little buzzers that softly buzz in your hands) to stimulate left-brain, right-brain back and forth. Then you focus on moments of trauma and the emotions tied into those traumas. The EMDR pulses allow your brain to process through what it was never able to process before, getting it &#39;unstuck&#39; and allowing it to fade into memory with less emotional intensity.
For childhood trauma, we also do a lot of imaginative work in EMDR, rewriting traumatic memories to bring in helper adults, aid, and resources you never had as a child, and also building up self-love in your childhood self. Has helped a lot with my core self-esteem.
I am a massive skeptic, and I realize a lot of this sounds like woo. But the peer-reviewed studies are out there. It&#39;s incredibly effective and for me, it&#39;s transformed my life. It&#39;s one of those things where they don&#39;t fully understand why it works, but it does.


hansuz     Sun Feb 4 01:25:55 2018 UTC

Hey, im feeling just like you, and the thing i&#39;ve learned to, is that i just need one beer in PUBLIC to feel &#39;normal&#39;. I hope you find someone/something to help you out. And feel free to pm me if you need to vent or anything.

Kukucarrot     Sun Feb 4 02:02:01 2018 UTC

I&#39;m super glad I hate the taste of alcohol and the smallest amount makes my stomach so upset that I can&#39;t really drink it because I&#39;d be an alcoholic otherwise. Alcohol gives me the ability to be who I want to be, sort of. 


liberty5651     Sun Feb 4 02:10:51 2018 UTC

Five years ago I&#39;d drink a six-pack and feel great.  I cut it out, and now 8oz makes me tired and crabby (honestly I can&#39;t say that&#39;s not because I&#39;ve aged).  


JoosyFroot     Sun Feb 4 03:30:46 2018 UTC

Not calling you out personally, just commenting for anybody that may be struggling with an alcohol problem.  I self-medicated for my anxiety with alcohol for some time, and wound up in the hospital, with a doctor telling me I was killing myself.
If you want to stop drinking, stop on by <a href="/r/stopdrinking" rel="nofollow">/r/stopdrinking</a>.  You&#39;ll get nothing but support there.  It helped me greatly once I admitted I had an alcohol problem.


_mach     Sun Feb 4 01:08:03 2018 UTC

Seriously, I think that&#39;s why gaming is such a fantastic drug for me; it takes so much concentration and focus to do it well that there&#39;s simply no processing power left for anxiety..


The_Grubby_One     Sun Feb 4 03:44:55 2018 UTC

It&#39;s escapism at its finest. Better than movies and books because it requires your active participation.

Expandexplorelive     Sun Feb 4 10:49:12 2018 UTC

I get anxiety trying to talk to people in an online game. Makes me not want to play sometimes...


Noooodle     Sun Feb 4 00:49:46 2018 UTC

But when you return to normal you spend the whole time worrying about things you said and did while in those states.


SenorGhostly     Sun Feb 4 01:22:03 2018 UTC

But then it all comes back the next day.  I‚Äôve spent so many mornings after a night drinking reliving everything I said cursing myself for being so stupid and embarrassing.  


Mel_Shitson     Sun Feb 4 01:49:16 2018 UTC

You hit the nail on the head! It‚Äôs even more pronounced with MDMA. It eliminates all inhibitions and at the time you are super overly confident... but the embarrassment you would have felt doing and saying all the shit you did and said hits you like a tonne of bricks. I don‚Äôt even like getting drunk or high on mdma anymore because the emotional comedown the next day is unbearable


liberty5651     Sun Feb 4 00:31:35 2018 UTC

If studied honestly, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll find drunkenness and drug use a consistent theme through most anxiety issues. It&#39;s actually compounding the problem. Spend the time that you would drinking to figure out how to be deep in thought about a topic you enjoy talking about. Drunkenness and drug use robs the thought and speech from you, and that is were you&#39;ll find the social connection. Please, don&#39;t misunderstand not all drink and drugs are bad, there&#39;s nice socializing there, but it&#39;s the addiction and the wasted time that makes it so.
Or, also, everyone can goto hell.  We don&#39;t need this.


ex_oh_ex_oh     Sun Feb 4 02:06:25 2018 UTC

Just as a personal anecdote, alcohol and drugs actually helped me get over my anxiety in about 90+% of social situations. Being friendly and personable while fucked up helped me connect with that side of me as a sober person. It gave me experience in settings that I was now familiar with and therefore not overthinking or paranoid about. 


GherkinEnthusiast     Sun Feb 4 00:36:11 2018 UTC

I find drug use (mostly mdma) helps me with my anxiety


antikarmakarmaclub     Sun Feb 4 00:39:26 2018 UTC

That‚Äôs interesting. Right before mdma I get super anxious to the point my throat throbs then once it hits its such a relief 


Domm311     Sun Feb 4 01:10:19 2018 UTC

The come up is the worst


shorun     Sun Feb 4 01:16:47 2018 UTC

thats anticipation.
you see something that relieves you so when you think &quot;now is the time&quot; you also let go, you anticipate the effect.
beware addiction, this is a dangerous thing.


antikarmakarmaclub     Sun Feb 4 01:20:28 2018 UTC

I feel like the two are def correlated. Never addicted, I‚Äôve always luckily had self control and spaced everything out, even with cigs which I feel like are easier to get addicted to, thanks brother


shorun     Sun Feb 4 01:30:05 2018 UTC

stay strong and never use drugs/alcohol as medication, once you need it you lost years at best, everything at worst. if you feel you cant hold on, seek help. 


liberty5651     Sun Feb 4 00:50:49 2018 UTC

I don&#39;t know anything about mdma, but I know I&#39;m a suspicious guy with conspiracy theories about myself.Is it a Pavlovian response?


JTtheLAR     Sun Feb 4 01:46:45 2018 UTC

Nah, it happens because of the anticipation. It&#39;s like the feeling of &quot;welp, no turning back now&quot;.


Senjoi     Sun Feb 4 01:02:37 2018 UTC

I&#39;m the same except with lsd


Hendlton     Sun Feb 4 02:24:27 2018 UTC

So, I just decided to read the Wikipedia page for MDMA and it basically sounds like a wonder drug. Effects:<ol><li>
Euphoria ‚Äì a sense of general well-being and happinessIncreased self-confidence, sociability and feelings of communication being easy or simple</li><li>
Entactogenic effects ‚Äì increased empathy or feelings of closeness with others and oneself</li><li>
Relaxation and reduced anxiety</li><li>
Increased emotionality</li><li>
A sense of inner peace</li></ol>
I feel like I&#39;d get addicted to that in a heartbeat.


MiotaBoi     Sun Feb 4 02:14:11 2018 UTC

MDMA is a pretty neat drug for many reasons. Something to be respected and taken properly, no doubt. I&#39;d say I roll every few months, it&#39;s always an amazing time which leaves me glowing for weeks, like seeing an amazing movie.
If you&#39;re mentally and physically healthy, then spending a night rolling with your S.O. or someone else you love is mafical, talk about lowering all walls.


niemandnirgendwer     Sun Feb 4 02:13:26 2018 UTC

If studied honestly, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll find drunkenness and drug use a consistent theme through most anxiety issues. It&#39;s actually compounding the problem.
There are quite a few studies and those things are definitely correlated and somewhat connected. <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh26-2/130-135.htm" rel="nofollow">E.g. this</a> 
Though I don&#39;t think <em>most</em> people with anxiety have a drug problem, just more than in the general population. 
Alcoholism (and other drugs addictions) can however prevent the diagnosis of other diseases. Hence it&#39;s a possible explanation why women have a higher incidence rate of depression - even if you correct for the lower percentage of men seeking help. 


Orc_     Sun Feb 4 01:35:10 2018 UTC

I kinda like my relationship with alcohol, I NEED alcohol to feel blissfully anxiety-free and I&#39;m ok with that, I think if I was anxiety-free all the time it wouldn&#39;t be blisful, it would just be natural...


Mradak     Sun Feb 4 00:55:41 2018 UTC

So what you&#39;re saying is we should be drunk all the time.


Newcool1230     Sat Feb 3 23:49:26 2018 UTC

Menacer256     Sun Feb 4 00:46:59 2018 UTC

Hit the gym 3 times a week and train hard. Anxiety disappears fast. Or greatly alleviated 


wowwoahwow     Sun Feb 4 01:17:09 2018 UTC

It‚Äôs actually interesting, recent research suggests depression isn‚Äôt so much connected to serotonin but rather a symptom of a lack of neurogenesis (growth and repair of brain cells). The best way to cause neurogenesis is through aerobic exercise.
Ironically though, my depression makes me have 0 will to run.


Menacer256     Sun Feb 4 01:34:16 2018 UTC

Takes about 3 months to make it habit and addictive.
Commit to 3 months of training.  I do no cardio. Only weights.
But pick a sport or something active.
I was depressed for 8 months and then just said fuck it and started


ExposDeezNuts     Sun Feb 4 02:14:51 2018 UTC

Did you notice your depression going away after weight training?


ruminajaali     Sun Feb 4 01:56:43 2018 UTC

That makes sense, because I actually feel &quot;smarter&quot; once I start exercising regularly.


Sakura48     Sun Feb 4 02:22:06 2018 UTC

You don&#39;t have to run though. Just a short walk outside can do wonder to your mental health.


Miss-Chinaski     Sun Feb 4 01:00:11 2018 UTC

Did this as an elective for a semester... Didn&#39;t do me any good. sometimes i would get really depressed afterward (esp if I did mostly cardio) and cry. Really pissed me off. I still go to the gym but I get social anxiety when men stare or follow me around the gym. 


Amazing1h     Sun Feb 4 01:19:06 2018 UTC

You have guys follow you around the gym? Jeez


Qewtoronto     Sun Feb 4 01:30:04 2018 UTC

I have the exact same experience- re: wanting to cry after cardio. Any idea why this is? 


xrumrunnrx     Sun Feb 4 01:36:50 2018 UTC

Just my experience, but working out regularly at a gym for over a year and losing tons of weight over a 2+ year period hasn&#39;t alleviated my social anxiety much. 
I&#39;m not generally depressed, which is huge, and so many things are positively impacted that I couldn&#39;t imagine going back to how things were...but saying exercise and a better physique cures genuine social anxiety is BS.


havefaiiithinme     Sun Feb 4 01:50:11 2018 UTC

I&#39;m a huge exercise advocate but I don&#39;t feel it always alleviates social anxiety (depression is a different story), I think what you&#39;re talking about stems from physical appearance insecurity and yes, exercise generally helps with that.. if that&#39;s the only issue. Social anxiety sometimes stems from other issues, it varies person to person.
I&#39;ve experienced social anxiety at my gym for the last 8-9 years. It&#39;s confusing, looking better/fit has given me this sense confidence that I don&#39;t fully believe in because of my anxieties.
I come across as this very physically fit, thoughtful, loving, 6-7/10, extremely confident guy. I&#39;m all of those but confident lol

And what happens when you can&#39;t go to the gym because ..... Social anxiety?


Chainreaction8     Sun Feb 4 01:17:20 2018 UTC

Start working out in your home, or dorm etc. Just start with little things like pushups, situps and yoga


zGunrath     Sun Feb 4 01:42:44 2018 UTC

When the social anxiety goes away the existential anxiety comes out to play.


apostledeets     Sun Feb 4 02:52:53 2018 UTC

Reoccurring thoughts of social anxiety:
I&#39;m in the way
I&#39;m being too loud.
I&#39;m not talking enough.
They think I&#39;m weird.
Does it look like I just picked my nose?
My nose itches, but I&#39;m afraid if I scratch it too much I&#39;ll look like a Coke head.
My skin arm itches but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll look like a meth head if I scratch too often.
I&#39;m going to get fired.
I&#39;m all caught up on work, but it looks like I&#39;m not doing anything.
I have the skills for this job, but I&#39;m going to blow the interview because my personality is dry and weird because of my social anxiety.
There&#39;s too many people in this aisle.
There&#39;s WAY too many people in this aisle.
I gotta get the fuck out of this aisle.
That&#39;s a cool shirt. Oh shit, does that chick think I just looked at her boobs?!?
I need to get over there, but I&#39;ll look like a creeper if I cut across the women&#39;s undergarments section.
That&#39;s just a brief synopsis of social anxiety


velezaraptor     Sun Feb 4 03:16:09 2018 UTC

At lunch, eating out: I would get up and get more ketchup from that o&#39;mighty red vat of goodness, but how much do I want to leave the confines of my established seat?
Oh! A new cashier line is opening up... I could literally sprint and beat everyone there...don&#39;t do that you pud...ah, you missed your chance and now you got line jumpers syndrome (semi- have to pee look). Then defeat, ride it out dude.
5,4,3 it&#39;s too close, I must hold the door for you stranger; with awkward silent stare, &quot;Thank you&quot; they said. No reply.
A slow walker drifting in the direction I&#39;m trying to pass you by speed walking, only to be awkwardly cut off, then by some building, then a pole, Arrrg!, do the slow jog to escape the situation.
Goes to gym to sign up, leaves after passing by the open showers with occupants. Shivers.


Wakebrite     Sun Feb 4 05:56:53 2018 UTC

Ooh, I want to play:
Why are they looking at me? There‚Äôs something wrong with how I look. That‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt like me.
She‚Äôs laughing, it must be because I‚Äôm so weird.
They seem overly friendly, they‚Äôre probably reacting to how shy I am. I should go away so they don‚Äôt feel like they need to be nice to me. I‚Äôm such a burden. 
Why are there so many people here today? I don‚Äôt know how to act. Should I move out of the way? Will that make me seem rude or make them feel like they‚Äôre being rude because they didn‚Äôt get out of the way?
Don‚Äôt make eye contact. He made eye contact. Why is he looking at me. He smiled but I didn‚Äôt smile. Now he‚Äôll think I‚Äôm an awful person. 
It‚Äôs a fun game you can play anywhere! 


philov     Sun Feb 4 08:42:20 2018 UTC

I want to try too!
Look at that couple taking an evening stroll, I better cross the street so I didn&#39;t get in the way of any conversation they might be having. But now it looks like I crossed the street because I want to avoid them and they&#39;re going to hate me for it. 
Uh oh, my phone&#39;s ringing and I&#39;m standing in line. Better pick it up fast so I don&#39;t get on anyone&#39;s nerves. But I can&#39;t leave the line to go to a quiet place to talk to whoever is calling. I&#39;ll just mute it and put it away, I hate talking on the phone anyway.
Is my hair messy? I&#39;ll smooth it down just in case. And again. One more time just in case. Last one.
I know the answer to the question the professor just asked the class but I should let someone else answer because they might want to stand out, of no one raises their hand I&#39;ll answer. Why is no one raising their hand? Maybe I misheard the question or it&#39;s a lot harder than I thought and my answer is completely wrong. I can&#39;t give a wrong answer that would be embarrassing.
I&#39;m bouncing my leg, why am I doing that? Everyone&#39;s probably super annoyed right now. 
Why does she keep coming to my table to talk to me? Is she trying to lure me into doing something bad? She does look really stunning right now. There&#39;s no way she would actually be interested in me. Should I get her some coffee? No she already has some, I don&#39;t know what to do in this situation. God this is awkward, I&#39;m just going to say that I need to get to class and leave.
No way, how did this happen, am I seriously wearing my leather jacket with my track pants? Stupid stupid stupid. That doesn&#39;t work. Only jeans can go with this jacket. If I go back to change I&#39;ll be late to class, but theres no way I&#39;m walking in looking like this. 
What&#39;s her name again? Its been three months, at this point it would be weird to ask, I&#39;ll just try to avoid having to interact with her from now on.
I get really anxious when people compliment me and I never believe that they are being sincere. I should add an example of that to my comment. Wait, but that&#39;s  going to seem like a humble-brag. I can&#39;t leave that out though, thats a big part of my anxiety! I know I&#39;ll talk about my anxiety about writing avout my anxiety about getting compliments. This still look like a humble-brag, but I guess thats what happens when you talk about yourself. I hope nobody&#39;s going to hate my comment for that.


DittoTrainer     Sun Feb 4 08:28:56 2018 UTC

You forgot the best one. ‚ÄúThat conversation I had 6 months ago? Oh god, that was awkward... They probably think i‚Äôm an idiot (still)‚Äù. And the whole day is ruined.


MambyPamby8     Sun Feb 4 10:17:29 2018 UTC

Also oh shit there&#39;s someone I know, who&#39;s always been fairly nice to me....better cross the road and pretend I didn&#39;t see them so I don&#39;t have to say hello and make awkward conversation. 
To be fair when I do this, I try drop them a text or message on Social Media later and say something along the lines of &quot;Hey I think I saw you earlier in town, was in a crazy rush so I couldn&#39;t stop to check if it was you but if it was,  Hey!&quot;


Atleastotried     Sun Feb 4 09:11:12 2018 UTC

After each conversation I would stress about every dumb thing I said, how the other person would think I was an idiot, and not trust me or whatever. I was talking with my friend over coffee and they told me the exact same thing. That after a job interview she was stressing out over every word. 
I finally realized this is something everyone does. Humans are selfish and all want to be liked and accepted by everyone else. When they walk away from your conversion, they don&#39;t think about what you said but instead what they said. They usually can&#39;t even remember what the other person said. 
The stress and anxiety I put myself through was pointless. 
There is a Buddhist proverb that says, &quot;Anger has no punishment, anger is your punishment.&quot; Meaning the anger you hold towards someone else is not hurting them but instead hurting you.  I&#39;m not mentioning this because of the anger part. I realized I could not hold on to the anger towards the people I was angry with and be in a healthy mind. So I analyzed why I was angry and hurt. The more I tried to let go, the less I cared about them. I was no longer angry towards them, I felt empty towards them. As if these people were nothing more than a stranger on the street. 
The reason I mention this is because I realized I could change my mental stance towards people and situations I was in. I started applying this towards my anxiaity. 
The more I realized that we are all selfish by nature. When I would be in a situation that my anxiaity would get the best of me, I would remember that the other person was just as concerned what I thought of them as they thought of me. And the pressure was lifted from me.
I&#39;m not saying this will help everyone. But perspective for me was a hell of a cure.

The older I get the more I understand not wanting to go out or do things. I like my bubble. It&#39;s a good bubble. 


liberty5651     Sun Feb 4 00:08:39 2018 UTC

Me, too, but it doesn&#39;t seem like anxiety if you comprehend the choice.


rainspider1999     Sun Feb 4 00:59:16 2018 UTC

This is pretty well said...


ElectronMcgee     Sun Feb 4 01:11:08 2018 UTC

Yeh sometimes I can&#39;t be bothered  going out or seeing people but it&#39;s more apathy than anxiety. 
Even though I&#39;m reasonably quiet in a big group it&#39;s more to do with not wanting to shout over anyone or not having any relevant input to the conversation 


Fluffcake     Sun Feb 4 04:03:17 2018 UTC

Avoid anything remotely unpleasant, and convince yourself it is a choice. I started letting people into my bubble instead of leaving it, worked out for me.


finnasuccit     Sun Feb 4 01:28:46 2018 UTC

I like my bubble but I hate on myself for liking my bubble. I wish I wanted to be more social but I‚Äôm not too sure if I‚Äôll ever enjoy it.


getakickoutofkik     Sun Feb 4 01:14:50 2018 UTC

Sounds more like introversion than anxiety


heeyyyyyy     Sun Feb 4 01:32:55 2018 UTC

Speaking as someone who is an introvert with social anxiety, I&#39;d say both these conditions intersect. 


Phazon2000     Sun Feb 4 01:48:24 2018 UTC

That&#39;s not true. I&#39;m extremely extroverted. I love talking to people. I love going out.
Problem is that when I <em>do</em> go out, internally it&#39;s very high stakes. My heart pounds. I get anxious when someone might look at me twice. Talking to someone I might like could leave me literally breathless and shaky.
I love going out and interacting and I love the feedback I get from people but I fairly obviously have social anxiety. I just don&#39;t withdraw because of it. Fight rather than flight.


heeyyyyyy     Sun Feb 4 01:56:30 2018 UTC

Well it&#39;s not necessarily a causal relationship always, these are very complex conditions. Plus, introverts also love talking to people or going out - it&#39;s a misconception to think they don&#39;t. 
But I dunno ..I guess they don&#39;t always intersect. I, for one, don&#39;t completely fit the tag of either, but I know I have elements of both.


meowctopus     Sun Feb 4 02:55:45 2018 UTC

Introversion ~= Uses/expels energy during a social gathering, needs time alone to recharge, sort their thoughts and feel full again
Extraversion ~= Gains energy and feels more invigorated during and after social situations. Benefits more from all the stimulation
Edit: It&#39;s not black and white and every person is a varying level of both. All of these equally capable of having some level of social anxiety


Crushgaunt     Sun Feb 4 03:14:02 2018 UTC

Did my thesis on introversion, can confirm that this is the ELI5 version.


Crushgaunt     Sun Feb 4 03:17:42 2018 UTC

<em>Can</em> intersect. They don&#39;t inherently do so, but they definitely can but they do exist as distinct and different things.


warren86     Sun Feb 4 00:39:32 2018 UTC

The scary part are the bubbles inside another bubble... 


Tarquin_Underspoon     Sun Feb 4 01:00:34 2018 UTC

It&#39;s bubbles all the way down.


ArchimedesNutss     Sun Feb 4 01:20:39 2018 UTC

Yeah but it sucks when people complain about your bubble because wanting to be by yourself ‚Äúis so wrong‚Äù just because they don‚Äôt know how to enjoy alone time themselves. 


WolfTitan99     Sun Feb 4 02:48:52 2018 UTC

the older you get?! Gee I‚Äôm only 18 and I totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from, so many people are obnoxious and the stress of going out in public for a long time is so draining. 
My bubble is also nice :)


odst94     Sun Feb 4 02:26:54 2018 UTC

The older I get, the more I realize my bubble is superficial and that thoughts are intangible so there&#39;s no point in regressing into my bubble. I&#39;m an social introvert. 


howtohidefromfriends     Sat Feb 3 21:04:37 2018 UTC

GetSame     Sun Feb 4 04:20:21 2018 UTC

Yes but you still live a better life if you shut your eyes. It&#39;s why conspiracy nuts are always frustrated, depressive loners. Because they can&#39;t let go of things that are beyond their control.

I swear that‚Äôs why I smoked in college! Ha, something to do with your hands. 
Now it‚Äôs which eyeball do I look at when I‚Äôm speaking to someone? Left? Right? Neither? Stare at the bridge of their nose? Can they tell I‚Äôm not looking at either eye? Holy shit, I‚Äôve heard nothing they‚Äôve said for the past minute. 


Lethrowajames     Sun Feb 4 02:05:11 2018 UTC

HAH! Everytime I somehow feel less anxious in a conversation this random thought completely fucks up my vibe. 


PerkyLlama     Sun Feb 4 03:25:18 2018 UTC

Is there actually a place you need to look though, I hate picking an eye 


bishkekpls     Sun Feb 4 03:51:55 2018 UTC

Perfectionist answer: Focusing on the nasal bridge is the most natural looking, from the other person&#39;s POV. Gazing into one eye is fine at a distance, but becomes increasingly asymmetrical as you approach.
Practical answer: Most people seem to choose a single eye (sometimes jumping back and forth), so it&#39;s not really a big deal. Wherever your gaze lands, just go with it. If you really listen, your eyes will tend to do the right thing.


Lethrowajames     Sun Feb 4 04:19:14 2018 UTC

I usually aim for both and the nose. But for real, just the thought popping up removes me from the conversation entirely back into my own head.


wuthrow7     Sun Feb 4 04:00:25 2018 UTC

You stare at their right ear. Make them as uncomfortable as you.

Drowsy-CS     Sun Feb 4 00:15:15 2018 UTC

Social anxiety is more instinctual than conscious, in my experience. It sometimes takes the form of overt thoughts, but it&#39;s usually more about bodily and emotional reactions.


tobiasvl     Sun Feb 4 01:16:08 2018 UTC

Yeah, I was going to say something similar. I have (mild) social anxiety, but it&#39;s not like paranoia or believing people are lying to me or talking about me behind my back, or similar things that the comments here are talking about. Sometimes I get really anxious and stressed out and my body has a fight-or-flight response, but it just comes out of the blue really. 


Ukani     Sun Feb 4 01:31:13 2018 UTC

And this is why I feel working out has helped me so much. You need an outlet to burn off all that adrenaline. 


Onion_God     Sun Feb 4 02:55:45 2018 UTC

That&#39;s why I masturbate 3+ times a day.


Crushgaunt     Sun Feb 4 03:41:34 2018 UTC

I know this is like 65% joke response but both this and the working out suggestion are 100% on point. 


spyser     Sun Feb 4 01:35:56 2018 UTC

I&#39;ve suffered from social anxiety for so long I&#39;ve kinda started to see it as its own entity. It always takes the same form, and always appears in the same situations. It&#39;s kinda helpful in a way, because that means I&#39;ll recognise it immediately, and can challenge it directly. Makes it easier to overcome.


thomshouse     Sun Feb 4 03:35:57 2018 UTC

I feel this way about both anxiety and depression. They are extra players in the room. Sometimes I can choose to ignore them. Sometimes they&#39;re too much to ignore, but I can manage them. It&#39;s much easier to deal with tgan letting them color your whole outlook.
(I know it&#39;s different for everyone. This is just what works for me.)


nyxxiris     Sun Feb 4 05:06:51 2018 UTC

I feel the same way. It&#39;s like it&#39;s another &quot;voice&quot; in my head and I&#39;m just starting to become aware of what that voice is saying and telling myself it&#39;s not necessarily true. Knowing and being aware does make it easier to overcome for sure. I&#39;ve made more progress in the past 6 months than I ever have knowing that.
Happy Cake Day, btw. üòä


oxct_     Sun Feb 4 01:53:02 2018 UTC

The physical part of social anxiety is the worst I think. My neck would &#39;lock up&#39;, like it was hard to move my head naturally. That must have looked so awkward. And then there&#39;s the constant need to go to the bathroom... Thankfully it&#39;s not really a problem for me anymore.
That&#39;s why I hate when people talk about social anxiety like it&#39;s cool or unique. I would&#39;ve given up my left nut just to feel normal.


cosmicrush     Sun Feb 4 01:15:07 2018 UTC

It is known that there are different forms of social anxiety. One form occurs in Schizotypal people and grows worse with exposure to people. This is the opposite trend you would expect from the other type of social anxiety, where you increasingly grow comfortable. 
The Schizotypal, with enough time, develops paranoid anxiety as they get closer to people.

Seeing a therapist and getting CBT was the best decision of my life. I&#39;ve gone from avoiding going into school for fear of being looked at in class to talking in front of a room of 40 people with ease. I&#39;ve beaten the shit outta social anxiety


KevPL     Sun Feb 4 02:22:50 2018 UTC

What is CBT?


sumoalbin     Sun Feb 4 02:42:03 2018 UTC

Cognitive behavior therapy, although there&#39;s a relatively new type of therapy called ACT (acceptance commitment therapy) which apparently has better results for depression, anxiety and stress disorders. 


itisxdotnet     Sun Feb 4 04:37:45 2018 UTC

Do you have any tips?


TestiCallSack     Sun Feb 4 10:32:48 2018 UTC

I&#39;d say it would depend on what the routes of your anxieties are. For me it was about learning not to be ashamed of feeling anxious and learning to accept the physical symptoms I would get.
Having a therapist who I could talk everything through with really helped. I&#39;d get set &quot;homework&quot; of things to try in situations where I got socially anxious. I really pushed myself to do these even if it felt super embarrassing and stressful at the time. Then every session we would analyze what happened the past week and look at the situations in which I felt what I felt. 
Being able to analyze this with someone instead of being stuck in my own head constantly was the most useful thing. I had quite a few realisations that helped me to overcome it. But it took time


Norfirio     Sun Feb 4 08:22:46 2018 UTC

I did CBT on my own over the past 3 months using the book &quot;Feeling Good&quot; by David Burns, and managed to overcome 90% of my anxiety (both social and general) from that along with daily meditation.
Reading a lot of these comments I think, &quot;huh, I remember when I used to think those things,&quot; but now those thoughts seem silly. I don&#39;t mean to say that people with anxiety are &quot;silly,&quot; I just mean that if people go to therapy and try CBT, the likelihood of getting a lot better is high.
Edit: after reading up on ACT (mentioned in another comment), it sounds pretty similar to what I&#39;ve been doing with my meditation practice.

Quite. Maybe more women just responded? Though women are generally better at talking which might explain things too. I myself can probably out talk a lot of women.. 


YouWantALime     Sun Feb 4 01:49:25 2018 UTC

Grenshen4px     Sun Feb 4 04:53:24 2018 UTC

Though women are generally better at talking which might explain things too.
Women tend to watch tv shows at a far higher rate than males especially comedy and/or drama related ones. The side effect is that they learn how to be more talkative just from exposure. 


thunderbeard317     Sun Feb 4 02:07:25 2018 UTC

A lot of those described me well. My husband has mentioned my tendency to repeat the same thing over and over. In fact, I have a lot of ‚Äúquirks‚Äù that he pointed out that actually made me stand out more. I explained that logically and rationally I know I do it, and I know it makes me look worse, but anxiety doesn‚Äôt give a single shit about my logic and rationale. I just cannot stop. 


Throwawayalt129     Sun Feb 4 01:30:38 2018 UTC

I just started going to a new therapist a few weeks ago, and one of the things he said to me that I never really thought of before was that anxiety in all its forms is basically the body&#39;s fight or flight response going haywire. It&#39;s basically the body making way more adrenaline than it needs to all the time. It really stuck with me, cause it&#39;s a really good explanation of what it feels like to be out in public for me.

Yeah I think the best way anxiety was ever explained to me was that when your body experiences stress, evolutionarily that stress could have been an animal coming to kill you or your only food source getting away from you. 
So going through a sort of &#39;worst case scenario&#39; for all of the situations that cause me anxiety helps me to reconcile with my brain that I don&#39;t need to be stressed by XYZ thought. 


Throwawayalt129     Sun Feb 4 03:33:33 2018 UTC

Pretty much exactly what the guy said. It&#39;s evolution gone haywire. He gave me relaxation techniques to try and help me relax in public that I haven&#39;t gotten to use cause I&#39;m too anxious to go out in public. 


Beantownbrews     Sun Feb 4 01:43:21 2018 UTC

I feel like this post is about me...


bitter_caroline     Sun Feb 4 02:21:29 2018 UTC

No one thinks about you as much as you do.


throwawaywaywayout     Sun Feb 4 07:16:40 2018 UTC

no one thinks about me as much as i think about them thinking about me


Keepthinkingdontstop     Sun Feb 4 01:44:53 2018 UTC

One of the biggest issues I struggle with is the reality that all though most of the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in this context are not true or real... some of them are. For example a common situation is thinking people want you to leave or are hinting that you should go. Well, sometimes they are doing exactly that and you should take the hint but you are trying so hard to relax and not give in to the conspiracies that you don&#39;t.
Actively fighting social anxiety can really make you socially deaf, blind and dumb. 


lurkhippo     Sun Feb 4 02:22:51 2018 UTC

Anxiety is like a bell curve where you want just enough to help you perform (notice social cues) but not so much that you read cues that aren&#39;t there and experience distress from your anxiety.


AnotherReignCheck     Sun Feb 4 02:02:52 2018 UTC

I&#39;m not sure if not realising when you&#39;re outstaying your welcome corresponds with anxiety, but I kinda see your point.


yokohoeno     Sun Feb 4 03:46:55 2018 UTC

It means some times you need to understand social cues and not assume it&#39;s just your anxiety.


proletarium     Sun Feb 4 04:20:00 2018 UTC

That&#39;s not even social anxiety at that point that&#39;s just a baseline level of perception 


RhodesianReminder     Sun Feb 4 00:53:03 2018 UTC

I have social anxiety and can&#39;t say my r&#39;s it&#39;s quite the trip.


pizzanice     Sun Feb 4 01:08:25 2018 UTC

What tip?


AnotherReignCheck     Sun Feb 4 01:58:20 2018 UTC

Can&#39;t say your what?


ncnotebook     Sun Feb 4 05:18:56 2018 UTC

really? rather inappropriate at unfavorable times, i presume. sorry, RhodesianReminder.


tarrega88     Sun Feb 4 01:25:56 2018 UTC

...  I think you just cured my social anxiety.


DowntownDilemma     Sun Feb 4 01:33:08 2018 UTC

Lmao right? I thought the same thing. 


tarrega88     Sun Feb 4 02:13:58 2018 UTC

I can feel my brain going through the process of rewiring itself so that it&#39;s no longer in the same category as anti-vaxxers and people who believe in chem trails.


DowntownDilemma     Sun Feb 4 02:42:00 2018 UTC

I have a date tonight, and up until I read the post I was real nervous. 
Now I&#39;m like, &quot;Calm the hell down. You&#39;re not ugly or a shitty person. Otherwise she wouldn&#39;t had agreed to this otherwise. Plus She&#39;s probably just as nervous as you are.&quot; 


gamerdude69     Sun Feb 4 04:25:12 2018 UTC

The burning sensation in your brain will subside once the work is complete. Should take about 57 hours.


Citizen52     Sun Feb 4 00:46:02 2018 UTC

I think im sufficiently worried about how sick people can be but i still have to be as efficient as possible  


Nomad27011     Sun Feb 4 03:05:55 2018 UTC

Last year I joined a Support Group for people with Social Anxiety.  We haven&#39;t had a meeting yet.


DeathToPinkDolphins     Sun Feb 4 09:40:49 2018 UTC

Something tells me you&#39;re not the only person concerned about that meeting.


wanker7171     Sun Feb 4 01:57:32 2018 UTC

&quot;girl I went on a date with had a terrible time&quot; texted me the next day apologizing for the silence and asking me what I had planned for us on valentines day. I hate anxiety


argv_minus_one     Sun Feb 4 07:57:57 2018 UTC

That sounds promising! Don&#39;t give up!


negativelist     Sun Feb 4 02:11:48 2018 UTC

Lol I can see that about myself, but the theories are based upon some factual connection, like any thought provoking conspiracy theory. For example my conspiracy theory that I am ugly is based on the fact that no woman has ever wanted to date me, or be with me in a romantic capacity. My theory that I do not have the ideal relationship experience is based on the fact the women I see online dating who talk about previous experience of an ideal partner always indicate they want &quot;moderately or slightly&quot; experienced, and I have literally no experience (kissing, as a boyfriend, or even dating). My theory that I have a small penis and will never be able to satisfy a partner if I ever find one is based on the statistical averages of penis length and girth reported in studies. 
Aw geez, now I feel terrible thinking about all of those failures at once! :/ 


Jagers554     Sun Feb 4 04:01:05 2018 UTC

Hey man I have very similar thoughts but you really gotta think about it. The saying that there is someone out their for everyone is really a true saying, if you look that is. Absolutely insane people have found matches that are perfect, like for example the couple that kept their like 17 kids locked up, they both were weird as fuck and agreed to it, if that dosent mean somebody is out there for everyone I don&#39;t know what it means


Spodjik     Sun Feb 4 00:58:25 2018 UTC

Not really though because it&#39;s based on actual verified data i.e. experience. Confidence is trust in yourself to deal with a particular situation, based on previous experiences, and anxiety is distrust. You know you can&#39;t approach that girl and have a positive interaction because you always fuck that sort of shit up.


NeonGreenShades     Sun Feb 4 01:51:41 2018 UTC

The quote &quot;Don&#39;t trust anyone, not even yourself.&quot; somehow fits here.


biggie_eagle     Sun Feb 4 02:01:32 2018 UTC

Then so are conspiracy theories. Watch any reputable conspiracy theory video and they&#39;ll lay on hours of verified data. Some of these might not even tell a single lie. It&#39;s just presented in a biased way and ignoring the official answers that leads people to think a certain way about the big picture.
moon conspiracy theory:<strong>there&#39;s no stars in pictures of the moon (they forgot to draw them in)... Van Allen radiation belts exist (humans can&#39;t cross them or else they&#39;d die) ... we can&#39;t see the moon rovers from Earth with telescopes (they were never there).... CONNECT THE DOTS.... THE MOON LANDING IS A HOAX!!!!</strong>
reality: 
There&#39;s no stars in the pictures because the camera contrast ratios can&#39;t accommodate capturing both the Moon AND the stars- the Moon would look completely white and there would be no details if you wanted to see the stars. radiation belts were only thought to be lethal in old scientific literature, you can&#39;t resolve something that small from so far away, there are no optical telescopes on Earth large enough to see them.
Social anxiety is the same way.  self conspiracy theory:
<strong>People are in a social situation and other people are laughing (must be about me) .... they&#39;re also avoiding eye contact with me (of course, you wouldn&#39;t look at someone you&#39;re laughing at)... it also feels awkward (of course, it always gets awkward when someone isn&#39;t welcome). CONNECT THE DOTS.... PEOPLE LOOK DOWN ON ME!!!!</strong>
reality: 
they&#39;re laughing because they&#39;re drunk. They&#39;re not looking at you because you&#39;re not drunk and understanding why they&#39;re laughing. It feels awkward only to you because of your anxiety.


Wellsargo     Sun Feb 4 02:07:24 2018 UTC

Honestly this isn&#39;t really true for me. I have a shit ton of self confidence. At times even to my detriment because I have a  bad habit of thinking I&#39;m better than some people. In my head or with complete strangers and close friends I can be very charismatic. It&#39;s just that I care far too much about the opinion people who fall in between those two categories have about me. So my social skills suffer badly. It takes me a ridiculously long amount of time to grow comfortable with new people because of this, and sometimes it never even happens. I don&#39;t think having social anxiety necessarily indicates a lack of self confidence in every case.


broadbandspf     Sun Feb 4 01:39:17 2018 UTC

Well this doesn&#39;t make me want to get over my social anxiety at all


ThePsychoKnot     Sun Feb 4 01:57:58 2018 UTC

Earlier today I walked past my recently-ex-landlord&#39;s kid. He was sitting with some friends, so I just walked by without saying anything. He didn&#39;t seem to notice me, but right after he was out of my view I literally thought I heard him say &quot;See this is exactly what I&#39;m talking about! Like he&#39;s soo insecure.&quot; 
Clearly he was talking about something else and I probably misheard a few words, but my brain was trying to convince me that he was talking shit about me to his friends. He&#39;s 14, I&#39;m 22, and he was always nothing but nice to me when I lived at his house. But all logic gets thrown out the window.


Haze345     Sun Feb 4 03:53:10 2018 UTC

&quot;They&#39;re only talking to me to make me feel better, when in reality they think I&#39;m annoying as fuck&quot;
Looking back that was probably true, and by looking back I mean last week


Byoobsincalifornia     Sun Feb 4 01:12:25 2018 UTC

What if we tell ourselves it‚Äôs just social anxiety so we feel better about people making fun of us behind our backs? 


fluffyjellybeana     Sun Feb 4 02:10:54 2018 UTC

The feelings are coming from inside your head!

I am willing to bet that I am the one who caused 7/11, and I&#39;m guessing it may have been a part time job.

She doesn&#39;t like me or my jokes, and i&#39;m enjoying her company way more then she&#39;s enjoying mind- she&#39;s just being polite.

<em>Oh god this is about me isn&#39;t it?</em>


serosis     Sun Feb 4 02:49:15 2018 UTC

No it isn&#39;t.
It&#39;s pure, unadulterated fear. 
The conspiracy-like thoughts are a symptom of it, not the cause.


_audiophile     Sun Feb 4 08:06:44 2018 UTC

0n another note, I feel like my social anxiety ruins my fucking life..


xyzxyx     Sun Feb 4 09:19:28 2018 UTC

Is anyone else really happy to see that so many people suffer from social anxiety because this post is so popular?  


Alepman     Sun Feb 4 00:52:30 2018 UTC

And your self-conscious is the deep state.... who could win?


AjenoMerveilles     Sun Feb 4 01:38:56 2018 UTC

Genuinely interesting way of putting it. I suffer from depression so social anxiety is the norm. My brain always tries to offer the conviction it is others judging me, whereas the reality (which I finally arrive at many exhausting, analytical, lonely hours later) tends to be I am judging myself in the eyes of others for no reason whatsoever. A form of projection, if you like.
Depression is all consuming, man. Goddam... Always so fucking tired.


12stepCornelius     Sun Feb 4 02:00:10 2018 UTC

&quot;Okay, okay, everyone&#39;s looking at me, I can feel it goddammit. What is a normal reaction to this? Do I look back at everyone? No, no, no. Too confrontational. Should I continue to just stare at my phone? No, be <em>here</em>, don&#39;t hide in your phone. Should I just, look around? Take in my surroundings?&quot; 
<em>awkwardly gazes around room, with the grace of a Parkinson&#39;s patient</em> 
&quot;Fuck! fuck! that felt so awkward! Did I just look at someone&#39;s taint? How did that happen? Just stay in your phone. Check reddit again. Yeah, yeah. Do that.&quot; 


Ironsweetiez     Sun Feb 4 07:26:49 2018 UTC

Oh my god, this happened to me today.  Is this anxiety? 


yohohoanda     Sun Feb 4 04:41:36 2018 UTC

You are the star of your own movie. Everyone else is the extra. Except everyone thinks that. So basically, you‚Äôre an extra. No one is watching you. Go Nuts kiddos.


Amiibohunter000     Sun Feb 4 06:49:29 2018 UTC

That is actually some great advice that speaks to me. Thanks 


yo_vlud     Sun Feb 4 03:07:37 2018 UTC

Im screenshotting this and setting it as my background so I never forget that all I need to do is just something


gorodos     Sun Feb 4 03:16:59 2018 UTC

That is pretty fucking accurate 


JMJimmy     Sun Feb 4 06:34:56 2018 UTC

Social anxiety, for me, has <em>zero</em> thought associated.  It&#39;s purely a physical reaction in the moment.  Like the fight or flight mechanism is triggered just by being around someone


Copicorn     Sun Feb 4 07:30:52 2018 UTC

What do you call the point where you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù because you‚Äôre so tired of caring about what people think? Because that‚Äôs where I am... 


btr154     Sun Feb 4 00:43:42 2018 UTC

That&#39;s more generalized anxiety, I think.


FidgetSpinInMyButt     Sun Feb 4 01:30:15 2018 UTC

I think paranoia, no?


ofthemountainsandsea     Sun Feb 4 00:55:39 2018 UTC

Thank you for this. I‚Äôve been super anxious all day, and this was very grounding to read.
