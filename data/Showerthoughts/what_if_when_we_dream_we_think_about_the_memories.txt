I don&#39;t think anyone else&#39;s memory is about me turning into a potato and getting into a shootout with Mr. Rogers and then my dad telling me he&#39;s disappointed I&#39;m not a real vegetable.

Or do I? Did I find my dream memory bank? Have you ever punted a block of cheese into a crowd of your peers while Morgan Freeman narrated your disappointing distance?

Kind of like when I dreamed you screamed “Victory” while taking a poop in a public bathroom? Yeah that happened... and don’t worry I know you did it.
