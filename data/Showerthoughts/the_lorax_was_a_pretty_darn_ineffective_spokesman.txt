Very ineffective spokesman. At no point did he clearly state the possible ramifications. And his final act was to bail on the whole situation.


mirrorspirit     Mon Feb 5 01:20:16 2018 UTC

Pointing out the possible ramifications would lead to statements like &quot;It&#39;s snowing outside, so obviously that global warming thing was a hoax.&quot;

He planted a seed of thought in the minds of millions of children. 


knolenftw     Sun Feb 4 21:15:45 2018 UTC

When I plant seeds in children I go to jail... life’s unfair

Dr. Nassar?

Too soon


trollsensei     Sun Feb 4 18:34:47 2018 UTC

Neat.


Camero32     Sun Feb 4 19:56:38 2018 UTC

Not neat enough

The ents from LOT would have done a better job


your-imaginaryfriend     Sun Feb 4 22:55:02 2018 UTC

Nobody messes with the ents. 


Finndalin12     Mon Feb 5 01:00:25 2018 UTC

LOT?..... LotR...


Benyed123     Mon Feb 5 01:23:14 2018 UTC

Never heard of Lord Of The?


catybatman     Sun Feb 4 21:41:32 2018 UTC

Perhaps it&#39;s because Dr. Seuss wasn&#39;t taken seriously enough due to the nature of his other works. I&#39;m gonna guess that &quot;Cat in the Hat&quot; and &quot;One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish&quot; were much better sellers. 


chadburycreameggs     Sun Feb 4 23:34:32 2018 UTC

Well, I mean. One fish, two fish is the greatest piece of literature ever created.


questionablyrotten     Sun Feb 4 21:43:32 2018 UTC

The remake was terrible


boatsbeaton     Sun Feb 4 22:40:28 2018 UTC

You try turning a 45 page children&#39;s book with 1-2 sentences per page into a full length film. You have to take some artistic liberty.  


beleriandsank     Sun Feb 4 22:56:35 2018 UTC

Alternatively, you could have not tried to stretch 45 pages into two hours of movie and saved yourself the problem of having to make up nearly all of it. 


questionablyrotten     Mon Feb 5 00:44:44 2018 UTC

There was already a 45 minute cartoon that was much better


Deris87     Sun Feb 4 23:32:46 2018 UTC

It was fine, and most importantly it hewed to the message of the book exactly even while expanding on the material. It wasn&#39;t amazing but it was perfectly fine for a kids movie, people just feel the need to shit on adaptations of things from their childhood. 


ImAThiefHelp     Sun Feb 4 23:43:32 2018 UTC

It was so, so memeable though.


Robo_Satan     Mon Feb 5 00:06:55 2018 UTC

And if you look at it in that context, it&#39;s a fantastic film.


ImAThiefHelp     Mon Feb 5 00:09:39 2018 UTC

But some people just want to let it shrivel up and die


boatsbeaton     Sun Feb 4 22:38:35 2018 UTC

&quot;Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It&#39;s not.&quot;
He should have said unless a whole lot of people like you care a whole awful lot. 
People just generally don&#39;t care. And that&#39;s the problem. 


cmedina22603     Mon Feb 5 00:01:21 2018 UTC

The only thing he succeeded in was guilt tripping the Onceler


CommentumNonSequiter     Sun Feb 4 20:03:53 2018 UTC

If by a bad spokesman you mean he was ignored by greedy humans who only realized their mistake once irreversible damage had been done to the environment they would one day pass on to the next generations, then yes you’re 100% right. 


bcg1117     Sun Feb 4 20:14:22 2018 UTC

Ineffective is not the same as bad.  He was clearly ineffective in that all the trees got chopped down.


CommentumNonSequiter     Sun Feb 4 20:37:48 2018 UTC

An argument isn’t ineffective just because it’s ignored at first. If anything the impact it had on the onceler years later is proof just how much weight the Lorax‘ words carried. If you make a compelling argument as to why we shouldn’t be racist, but people continue to harbor prejudice based on skin color that doesn’t mean you’re shitty at debating. It means your audience is close minded. 


Wincrediboy     Sun Feb 4 22:00:08 2018 UTC

You&#39;re still confusing ineffective with bad. An authentic is bad if it has false premises or poor logic. An argument is ineffective if it has no effect, i.e. if you can&#39;t motivate action or change minds. If people are too close minded to hear your argument, that doesn&#39;t make it bad, but it does make it ineffective. Actual results matter, not just the theoretical results that your argument &#39;deserved&#39;.


bthompson04     Sun Feb 4 21:26:16 2018 UTC

Let’s not lump humans in with Once-lers, now. 


boatsbeaton     Sun Feb 4 22:42:24 2018 UTC

There was only one once-ler, and he was a human. 


bthompson04     Sun Feb 4 22:46:32 2018 UTC

He literally calls all of his brothers, uncles, and aunts to help him at the factory:<blockquote>
I called all my brothers
and uncles and aunts
Then they show up and work:<blockquote>
And in no time at all
in the factory I&#39;d built
the whole Once-ler family
was working full tilt.
Then, after the last Truffula tree is chopped down, they all leave:<blockquote>
So in no time my uncles
and aunts, every one...
all waved me good-bye
<strong>Source:</strong> I have a toddler that&#39;s obsessed with the book. I read it. A lot.


THE_MAGIC_OF_REALITY     Sun Feb 4 23:34:21 2018 UTC

His uncles and aunts don’t necessarily have to be oncelers as well. They could just be humans


bmoney831     Sun Feb 4 22:45:37 2018 UTC

Trees!! Thanks OP, you just helped get a bit further in my crossword puzzle


rapplechackles     Sun Feb 4 23:42:40 2018 UTC

Snoop Dogg would be the better spokesman.

Hey! That was on cable today! 


Lemesplain     Mon Feb 5 01:22:29 2018 UTC

That&#39;s why we need Swamp Thing. 
He speaks for the trees, by whooping ass. 


Pseudocuber     Mon Feb 5 01:27:53 2018 UTC

The real lesson to take from that is that we can destroy the world and thats ok because someone will fix it for us.


Hygro     Sun Feb 4 23:29:19 2018 UTC

The Once-ler is the one to save the seed and inspire the boy to replant the Truffula Trees. Lorax ain&#39;t shit.
